F   Dm   F   Bb   F   Am   Bb   Csus-C

       F             Bb         F                       F
The screen door slams  Mary's dress waves       Like a vision she dances 
   C                       Bb                                          C
across the porch    As the radio plays    Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
            F                 Bb                                  F
Hey that's me and I want you only    Don't turn me home again  I just can't face 
   C
myself alone again
       F                        Bb                       F
Don't run back inside    darling you know just what I'm here for
                                             C                   Bb
So you're scared and you're thinking   That maybe we ain't that young anymore
                                           C
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
             F                        Bb              F                  C
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright   Oh and that's alright with me
         F                            Dm                    F
You can hide neath your covers  And study your pain  Make crosses from your lovers
      Bb                F                    Am
Throw roses in the rain   Waste your summer praying in rain
       Bb                           C7              F
For a saviour to rise from these streets   Well now I'm no hero
       Dm                     F                               Bb
That's understood  All the redemption I can offer, girl Is beneath this dirty hood
F                          Am                 Bb                 C7
 With a chance to make it good somehow  Hey what else can we do now
        F                     Bb                     F
Except roll down the window   And let the wind blow back your hair
                                        C                    Bb
Well the night's busting open   These two lanes will take us anywhere
                                   C          F                            Bb
We got one last chance to make it real   To trade in these wings on some wheels
                 F                 C
Climb in back   Heaven's waiting on down the tracks   
F           Dm               F                    Bb
Oh oh come take my hand     Riding out tonight to case the promised land  
F  Am               Bb              C7
Oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road  
 F                      Dm                        F
Lying out there like a killer in the sun      Hey I know it's late 
        Bb                 F         Am         Bb          C7             F
we can make it if we run   Oh Thunder Road, sit tight take hold   Thunder Road
       Bb                        C                         F
Well I got this guitar    And I learned how to make it talk
       Dm                                              Bb   C
And my car's out back    If you're ready to take that long walk
           Bb                      C               Am                          Dm
From your front porch to my front seat  The door's open but the ride it ain't free
       Bb              Bb/A               Gm7      Bb/F
And I know you're lonely   For words that I ain't spoken
       C
But tonight we'll be free    All the promises'll be broken
             F                        Bb              F
There were ghosts in the eyes    Of all the boys you sent away
                                           C                 Bb
They haunt this dusty beach road  In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
                                            C                 F
They scream your name at night in the street Your graduation gown lies in rags at 
    Bb                        Am
their feet        And in the lonely cool before dawn
               Bb                                Gm                        C
You hear their engines roaring on   But when you get to the porch they're gone
       Bb                  Gm            Bb
On the wind, so Mary climb in    It's a town full of losers
         C                      F  F
And I'm pulling out of here to win.
