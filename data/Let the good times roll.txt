Hey everybody
let's have some fun
you only live once
and when you're dead you're done
so let the good times roll
let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
get together and let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumblin' 
talkin' trash
if you wanna have some fun
you gotta spend some cash
