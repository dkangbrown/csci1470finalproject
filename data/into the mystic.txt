
[Verse 1]

     C
     We were born before the wind
     C
     Also younger than the sun
     G
     'Ere the bonny boat was won
     G                     C
     As we sailed into the mystic


[Verse 2]

     C
     Hark, now, hear the sailor's cry
     C
     Smell the sea and feel the sky
     G
     Let your soul and spirit fly
     G          C
     Into the mystic.


[Bridge]

     Em               F            
     When that foghorn blows,
              C
     I will be comin' home, Mmm hmm hm
     Em               F                
     When that foghorn blows,
            G
     I wanna hear it, I don't have to fear it


[Chorus]

         C
     And I  wanna rock you gypsy soul
     C
     Just like way back in the days of old
     G
     And magnificently we will float
     G          C
     Into the mystic

[Bridge]

     Em       F               
     When that foghorn blows,

     you know I will be comin' home
     Em            F                     G       
     And when that foghorn whistle blows,
     G
     I've gotta hear it, I don't have to fear it


[Ending chorus]

     C
     And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
     C
     Just like way back in the days of old
     G
     And together we will float
     G           C
     Into the mystic ............... Come on girl!
