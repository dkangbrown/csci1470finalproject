Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                       A7                                                          
Hang down your head and cry,

Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                        D
Poor boy, your bound to die,


[Verse]

D
I met her on the mountain,
                     A7
and there I took her life,

Met her on the mountain,
                    D
stabbed her with my knife,


[Refrain]

D
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                       A7
Hang down your head and cry,

Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                        D
Poor boy, your bound to die,


[Verse]

D
This time tomorrow,
                 A7
reckon' where I'd be,
               
Hadn't been for Grayson,
                  D
I'd been in Tennessee,


[Refrain]

D
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                       A7
Hang down your head and cry,

Hang down your head Tom Dooley,

Poor boy, your bound to die,


[Verse]

This time tomorrow,
                  A7
reckon' where I'll be,

Down in some lonesome valley,
                        D
hangin' from a wide oak tree,


[Refrain]

D
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,

Hang down your head and cry,
   
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,

Poor boy, your bound to die,


D
Hang down your head Tom Dooley,
                       A7
Hang down your head and cry,

Hang down your head Tom Dooley,

Poor boy, your bound to die.
