Oh, a storm is threat'ning 

My very life today 

If I don't get some shelter 

Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away 

B    A        G
War, children, it's just a shot away 

It's just a shot away 
B    A        G
War, children, it's just a shot away 

It's just a shot away 

B
Ooh, see the fire is sweepin' 

My very street today 

Burns like a red coal carpet 

Mad bull lost its way 

B    A        G
War, children, it's just a shot away 

It's just a shot away 
B    A        G
War, children, it's just a shot away 

It's just a shot away

Rape, murder!

It's just a shot away 

It's just a shot away

Rape, murder! 
G
It's just a shot away 

It's just a shot away

B
The floods is threat'ning 

My very life today 

Gimme, gimme shelter 

Or I'm gonna fade away 

B    A        G
War, children, it's just a shot away 

It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away 

It's just a kiss away 
B
It's just a kiss away 
A

It's just a kiss away 

Kiss away, kiss away
