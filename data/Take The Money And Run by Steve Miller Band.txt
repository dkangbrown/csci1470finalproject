G             F                           C
This heres a story about billy joe and bobbie sue
G               F                C
Two young lovers with nothin better to do
G                           F                 C
Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube
G                       F                              
 E5/F5
And here is what happened when they decided to cut loose
G                           F            C
They headed down to, ooh, old el paso
G                       F                C
Thats where they ran into a great big hassle
G           F                       C
Billy joe shot a man while robbing his castle
G               F                              C              E5-F5-F#5-G
Bobbie sue took the money and run


[Chorus]
Chorus - Sounds good as powerchords, although you can play open chords over the lyrics 
it'll still sound pretty good.
(G)      F                            C                       E5-F5-F#5-G
Go on take the money and run
G        F                             C                      E5-F5-F#5-G
Go on take the money and run
G        F                             
 E5-F5
Go on take the money and run
G        F                             C
Go on take the money and run

~~~~As you can tell, it's pretty much the same chord progression, so I've just thrown in 
couple of the transition-type thingers


[Verse]
Billy mack is a detective down in texas
You know he knows just exactly what the facts is
He aint gonna let those two escape justice
He makes his livin off of the peoples taxes     C5-E5  E5-F5
Bobbie sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away
Billy joe caught up to her the very next day
They got the money, hey
You know they got away                  E5-F5-F#5-G
They headed down south and theyre still running today   C5-E5  E5-F5
                                                               (Singin)

[Chorus]
Go on take the money and run    (Alternate between the two riffs)
Go on take the money and run
Go on take the money and run
Go on take the money and run
Go on take the money and run
Go on take the money and run
Go on take the money and run
Go on take the money and run
