I like to dream
          D       C        G             D C G     
Yes, yes, right between my sound machine
     D                C            G
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
    D        C       G
Any place it goes is right
     D          C                   G
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here

Well, you don't know what we can find
D                       C         G
Why don't you come with me little girl
     D     C      G
On a magic carpet ride
D   C     G         D  C   G
You don't know what we can see
D                       C         G
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
D            C       G
Fantasy will set you free

G                     Bb
Close your eyes girl, look inside girl
C                       G
Let the sound take you away

Last night I held Aladdin's lamp
And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well, someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around, a lousy candle's all I found

      D   C     G         D  C   G
Well, you don't know what we can find
D                       C         G
Why don't you come with me little girl
     D     C      G
On a magic carpet ride
D   C     G         D  C   G
You don't know what we can see
D                       C         G
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
D            C       G
Fantasy will set you free
