I should of quit you a long time ago
I should of quit you babe a long time ago
I should of quit you and went on to Mexico

If I'd had followed my first mind
If I'd had followed my first mind
I'd a been gone since my second time

If I had a went on
when my best friend come at me
If I had went on
when my best friend come at me
lord I wouldn't be here tonight down on the killing floor

god knows I shoulda went on
god know I shoulda went on
and I wouldn't be here tonight down on the killing floor
