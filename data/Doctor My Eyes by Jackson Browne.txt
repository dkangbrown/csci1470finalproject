Capo on 1st fret, all chords are relative 

[Verse]

E  
Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
             G#m                      C#m
And the slow parade of fears without crying
       A         E 
Now I want to understand   

I have done all that I could, to see the evil and the good
without hiding.  You must help me if you can


[Chorus]

C#m               E
Doctor, my eyes, tell me what is wrong
        C#m                 B             A, E,  D/E, A/E, E
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long


[Verse]

E  
'Cause I have wandered through this world
             G#m                      C#m
And as each moment has unfurled,  I've been waiting
       A         E 
to awaken from these dreams

People go just where there will,  I never noticed them until

I got this feeling, that it's later than it seems


[Chorus]

C#m                E
Doctor, my eyes, tell me what you see
C#m                              B              D/E**, A,(E,D/E,A/E,E rept)
I hear their cries, just say if it's too late for me


[Instrumental break]


[Chorus]

C#m              E
Doctor, my eyes cannot see the sky
C#m                           B                  A, E,D/E, /E, E 
Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry




*D/E. Played on an acoustic guitar, this sounds more like the
piano chord when the form is played from 2nd position and extended
over 3 frets.  Notes:  E, A. F#, A, D, F#
