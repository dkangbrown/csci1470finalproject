{G D C D} x6


[Verse 1:]

                G     D         C        D          G
I'll bet you've never heard ole Marshall Dillon say
    D               C            D               G
Miss Kitty have you ever thought of running away
  D          C           D        G
Settling down, would you marry me
   D           C                    D             G     
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please
       D          C            D         G   
She'd have said yes in a New York minute
     D                 C
They never tied the knot
D                G     
His heart wasn't in it
 D              C            D
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
G          D       C
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place


[Chorus:]

                   G       D     C
I should've been a cowboy
D                      G        D      C     D
I should've learned to rope and ride
        G          D      C        D                  G    D    C
Wearing my six-shooter, riding by pony on a cattle drive
D           G           D      C     D
Stealing a young girl's heart
G         D         C
Just like Gene and Roy
D             G      D        
Singing those rodeo songs
C      D               G      D     C         
Oh I should've been a cowboy


[Verse 2:]

           G          D           C      D
I might of had a side kick with a funny name
         G               D        C          D
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
G      D         C        D   
Ending up on the brink of danger
G           D          C      D
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
    G         D          C          D
Go west young man, haven't you been told
    G          D          C         D
California's full of whisky, women and gold
         G         D              C       D
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
   G          D         C            D
A dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart


[Chorus:]

                   G       D     C
I should've been a cowboy
D                      G        D      C     D
I should've learned to rope and ride
        G          D      C        D                  G    D    C
Wearing my six-shooter, riding by pony on a cattle drive
D           G           D      C     D
Stealing a young girl's heart
G         D         C
Just like Gene and Roy
D             G        D        
Singing those campfire songs
C      D               G      D     C         
Oh I should've been a cowboy
