[Verse 1]

          Em                G
Now she's walking through the clouds
       Am                        Em
With a circus mind that's running wild
Bm                      Am                      C
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams, and fairy tales
G            F            C                   D
All she ever thinks about is 

Riding with the wind

(It's the same chords through the whole song)


[Verse 2]

        Em              G
When I'm sad she comes to me
        Am                          Em
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
Bm                      Am       C
It's alright, it's alright she says
G        F       C              D
Take anything you want from me

Anything


[Outro]

Em      G                  Am
          Fly little wing...


Em   Bm   Am   C   G   F   C   D


[Ending]

Em
