[G] Mother, mother ocean,  
I have heard you call 
[C] Wanted to sail upon your waters 
since I was [D] three feet [G] tall 
You've seen it [Am] all, 
[Bm] you've seen [Am] it [G] all  [C]-[G]

[G] Watched the men who rode you,  
switch from sails to steam 
[C] And in your belly you hold the treasures 
[D] few have ever [G] seen 
Most of 'em [Am] dream, 
[Bm] most of [Am] 'Em [G] dream  [C]-[G]

[G] Yes I Am A pirate,  
two hundred years too late 
[C] The cannons don't thunder, 
there's nothin' to plunder 
I'm an over-forty [D] victim of [G] fate 
Arriving too [Am] late, 
[Bm] arriving [Am] too [G] late 

[G] I've done a bit of  smugglin',  
I've run my share of grass 
[C] I made enough money to buy Miami, 
but I pissed it [D] away so [G] fast 
Never [Am] meant to last, 
[Bm] never [Am] meant to [G] last [C]-[G]

[G] And I have been drunk now for over two weeks 
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks 
But I [C ]got stop wishin', got to go fishin' 
Down to [D] rock bottom [G] again 
Just a few [Am] friends, 
[Bm] just A [Am] few [G] friends 

[instrumental]  G  C  D  G  Am  Bm  G

[G] I go for younger women, 
lived with several awhile 
[C] Though I ran 'em away, 
they'd come back one day 
Still could [D] manage to [G] smile 
Just [Am] takes a while, 
[Bm]  just Am takes A [G] while 

[G] Mother, mother ocean, 
after all the years I've found 
C My occupational hazard being 
my occupation's just [D] not [G] around 
I feel like I've [Am] drowned, 
[Bm] gonna [Am] head up [G] town 


[Coda]

I feel like I've [Am] drowned, 
[Bm] gonna [Am] head up [G] town [C]-[G]
