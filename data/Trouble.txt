I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids

G                                        
Mama had a time tryin' to raise nine kids

G                                             
She told me not to stare cause it was impolite

G                                                  
She did the best she could to try to raise me right


     C                                           G
Caus-e mama never told me 'bout nothin' like Y-O-U

           D                        C                   G
