F, Bb

Without a warning you broke my heart
You took it darlin' and you tore it apart
You left me sitting in the dark, crying
You said your love for me was dying

I'm begging you, baby, baby please
I'm begging you, baby, baby please
Turn on the light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
And let it shine, shine, shine, let it shine

I got a little lonely
In the middle of the night
I need you darlin'
To make things all right

Come on baby, come on please
Come on baby, baby please
Turn on the light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
A little bit higher, a little bit higher
Just a little bit higher, a little bit higher
A little bit higher

Come on baby, come on please
I'm begging you, I'm down on my knees
Turn on the light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me

I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright, baby
