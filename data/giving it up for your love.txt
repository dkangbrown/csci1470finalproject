Break with sax solo keep playing C, Gm7, F, progression


I know you told me 
That you'd always love me
And I believed it was true
So I saved the best and I'm ready
My love only just for you
Come back here, come back real quick
My body's aching, and my heart is feeling weak
I'll be all right, I'll be OK
Come on baby, listen to what I say
G
I don't need your money, don't need your car
I'm doing all right, doing all right so far



Chorus – Repeat and fade
