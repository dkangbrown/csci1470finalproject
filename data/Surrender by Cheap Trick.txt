Intro: Am    G     Dm        C      E7  x2
Am                     G
She reads a book from across the street
Dm                         C           E7
Waiting for someone that she'll never meet
Am                               G
Billy Talk over coffee for an hour or two
Dm                           C        E7
She wonders why I'm always in a good mood
Am                            G
Killing time before she struts her stuff
Dm                          C            E7
She needs support and I've become the crutch
Am                                 G 
She'll never know how much she means to me
Dm                      C          E7
I'd play the game but I'm the referee

[CHORUS]
F                         G           
(Surrender)
Every word, every thought, every sound
Am                        D
(Surrender)
Every touch, every smile, every frown
F                         G
(Surrender)
All the pain we've endured until now
Am                         D
(Surrender)
All the hope that I lost you have found
F         G            D  
(Surrender) Yourself to me

Intro: 1x

Even though I know what I'm looking for
Lyric She's got a brick wall behind her door
I'd travel time and confess to her
Liedertexte But I'm afraid she'd shoot the messenger

[CHORUS]

A5                              Bb5
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
            F5                   G5
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
A5                      Bb
Searching until my hands bleed
Dm                 C       E7
This flower don't belong to me

I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
Talent I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
Surrender Searching until my hands bleed
Dm                C       E7
This flower don't belong to me
Dm                C       E7
This flower don't belong to me
Dm                C    E7 
Why can't she belong to me?

F      G       Am       D    continue!

Every word, every thought, every sound
Every touch, every smile, every frown
Lyrics All the pain we've endured until now
All the hope that I lost, you have found
Lyric 
[CHORUS]

(Surrender)
I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender)
Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender)
I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender)
Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender)
I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender)
Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender)
I never had the nerve to ask
