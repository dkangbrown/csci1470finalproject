B
I saw her standin' on the corner.

A yellow ribbon in her hair.

I couldn't stop myself from shouting..
       F#
Look A-there! Look A-there!

Look A-there! Look A-there!

CHORUS:
E            B            E
Young blood, young blood, young blood..
  F#7                        
I can't get you out of my mind.

B
I took one look and I was fractured.

I tried to walk but I was lame.

I tried to talk but I just stuttered..
F#
What's your name? What's your name?

What's your name? What's your name?

CHORUS:
E            B            E
Young blood, young blood, young blood..
  F#7

CHORUS:#2.
E
What crazy stuff! She looked so tough.
B                                  
I had to follow her all the way home.
C#7
Then things went bad..I met her dad.
          F#7
He said, 'You'd better leave my daughter alone.'

#3.
B
Well, I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'.

I saw the rising of the sun.

And all night my heart was cryin'..
F#
You're the one, you're the one,

You're the one, you're the one!
