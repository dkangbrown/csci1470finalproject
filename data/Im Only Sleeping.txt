Em                          Am       G       C    G         B7
When I wake up early in the morning, lift my head I'm still yawning.
Em                          Am     G       C   G       C
When I'm in the middle of a dream, stay in bed float upstream.
G                    Am                Bm               Am
Please don't wake me no don't shake me leave me where I am
         Cmaj7
I'm only sleeping

Em                           Am    G       C      G             B7
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy, I don't mind I think they're crazy
Em                           Am     G        C    G          C
Running everywhere at such a speed 'til they find there's no need
G                     Am             Bm            Am
Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away and after all
         Cmaj7    Em
I'm only sleeping

D7                    E7                Am  Am7
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,
Dm
Taking my time

Em                             Am       G       C     G      B7
Lying there and staring at the ceiling, waiting for a sleepy feeling 

G                     Am             Bm            Am
Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away and after all
         Cmaj7   Em
I'm only sleeping                    

D7                    E7                Am  Am7
