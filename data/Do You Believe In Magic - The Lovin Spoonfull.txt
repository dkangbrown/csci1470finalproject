G                 C          F
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
        C                       F
How the music can free her, whenever it starts
         C             F
And it's magic, if the music is groovy
   C                            F
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
     Dm                 Em               F         Em
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
              G
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll

                  C           F
If you believe in magic don't bother to choose
        C                 F
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
            C            F
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile
         C                            F
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
     Dm         Em              F             Em
Your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find
            G
How you got there, so just blow your mind

                  C            F
If you believe in magic, come along with me
      C                                F
We'll dance until morning 'til there's just you and me
    C             F
And maybe, if the music is right
     C                          F
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
    Dm       Em             F           Em
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
        G
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

                        C
Yeah, do you believe in magic
      F              Em         F            Em
Yeah, believe in the magic of a young girl's soul
  F            Em       F        Em
Believe in the magic of rock and roll
  F            Em             F       Em
Believe in the magic that can set you free
                   F
Ohh, talking 'bout magic

   C     Dm         Em   Dm      
Do you believe like I  believe 5x
