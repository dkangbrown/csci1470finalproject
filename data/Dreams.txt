Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom;
F            G             F
Well, who am I to keep you down?
          G                     F                G
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it;
    F             G         F
but listen carefully to the sound

        G                 F                    G
Of your loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad
       F              G                  F    G
In the stillness of remembering what you had,
             F    G
and what you lost
             F    G
And what you had,
             F
and what you lost

    Fmaj7        G6                F      G
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Fmaj7        G6                    F      G
Players only love you when they're playing
     Fmaj7           G6                 F  G
Say, women they will come and they will go
Fmaj7         G6                       F   G        F
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions;
F         G            F
I keep my visions to myself
          G               F                G
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and;
F            G                    F     
have you any dreams you'd like to sell?

          G                 F                    G
Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad
       F              G                  F    G
In the stillness of remembering what you had,   (lonely)
             F    G
and what you lost
             F    G
And what you had,
             F
and what you lost

You will know, whoa o o, you'll know
