Intro: C Am C Am

    C                 Am
I heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the lord
    F                G               C        G
But you don't really care for music, do you? 
        C                              F           G
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
       Am                       F
The minor fall and the major lift
       G               Em             Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Chorus:

     F           Am          F                  C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah .... 

The rest of it follows the same chord progression....
