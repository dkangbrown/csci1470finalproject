There will be a show tonight on trampoline

The Hendersons will all be there

Late of Pablo Fanques Fair- what a scene!
     Dm             
Over man and horses hoops and garters
Bb               A7          Dm  
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
        Bb      A                     Dm    Gm  A7  Dm  G
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring- don't be late!
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
       Bb               A                Dm    
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

F+  C  A Dm F+  C  B  Em   G

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground
We've been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill!
