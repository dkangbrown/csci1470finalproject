[Root] G


[Verse 1]

      G
I was born by the river, in a little tent,
       Am7                                       Em
Oh and, just like that river, I've, been running, ever since.
            G         Am7                     C7          B7
It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
Em                           G
 A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.


[Verse 2]

          G
It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die,
Am7                                 Em
 'Cos I don't know what's out there, beyond the sky.
            G         Am7                     C7          B7
It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
Em                           G
 A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.


[Verse 3]

  G
I go to the movie and I go downtown,
Am7                              Em
 Somebody keep telling me; don't, hang around.
            G         Am7                     C7          B7
It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
Em                           G
 A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.


[Bridge]

Am7              G6
 Then I go to my brother,
Am7                          Em
 And I say; brother, help me please.
Am7              Em
 But he winds up, knockin' me,
A9               D7
 Back down on my knees, oh...


[Verse 4]

           G
There been times when I thought, I couldn't last for long,
Am7                          Em
 But now I think I'm able to, carry on.
            G         Am7                     C7          B7
It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
Em                           G
 A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.
