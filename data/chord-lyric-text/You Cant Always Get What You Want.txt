[Root] G

[Verse]

    G   Gadd9 G               C
I saw her today at the reception,
   G    Gadd9 G        C
a glass of wine in her hand
   G   Gadd9 G                C
I knew she was gonna meet her connection,
      G   Gadd9 G            C
at her feet was a footloose man


[Chorus]

     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
            A                  C                           G
but if you try sometimes, you might find, you get what you need

    G   Gadd9 G         C
I went down to the demonstration,
   G   Gadd9 G          C
to get my fair share of abuse
   G   Gadd9 G                 C
Singing, "we're gonna vent our frustration,
      G   Gadd9 G                C
if we don't we're gonna blow a 50 amp fuse"


[Chorus]

     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
            A                  C                           G
but if you try sometimes, you might find, you get what you need

     G    Gadd9 G          C
I went down to the Chelsea Drug Store,
   G    Gadd9 G          C
to get your prescription filled
    G    Gadd9 G            C
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
    G    Gadd9 G           C
and man did he look pretty ill

   G    Gadd9 G            C
We decided we would have a soda,
   G    Gadd9 G           C
my favorite flavour: cherry red
  G    Gadd9 G        C
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy,
       G    Gadd9 G                   C
and he said one word to me and that was "dead"


[Chorus]

     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
            A                  C                           G
but if you try sometimes, you might find, you get what you need

   G    Gadd9 G             C
I saw her today at the reception,
       G    Gadd9 G        C
in her glass was a bleeding man
    G    Gadd9 G                C
She was practiced at the art of deception,
        G    Gadd9 G             C
I could tell by her bloodstained hands


[Chorus]

     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
     G   Gadd9 G              C
You can't always get what you want
            A                  C                           G

You can't always get what you want
