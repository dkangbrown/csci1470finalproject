[Verse 1]

E              B          F#m
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
          F#m          B           E
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
E            B             F#m
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
          F#m       B           E
And I'll try not to sing out of key.


[Chorus]

      D                A            E
I get by with a little help from my friends,
      D                  A            E
I get high with a little help from my friends,     
         D                 A            E             B
Going to try with a little help from my friends.   (break)


[Verse 2]

E         B           F#m
What do I do when my love is away.
         F#m          B   E
(Does it worry you to be alone)
E        B           F#m
How do I feel by the end of the day
         F#m                B       E
(Are you sad because you're on your own)


[Chorus]

      D                A            E

(Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.)
E           B            F#m
What do you see when you turn out the light,
         F#m             B         E
(I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.)


[Chorus]

      D                A            E
