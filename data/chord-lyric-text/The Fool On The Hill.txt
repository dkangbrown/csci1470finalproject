[Verse 1]

         D6              Em/D
         day after day, alone a hill
             D6                               Em/D
         the man with foolish grin is keepinf perfectly still
             Em7               A7               D6                    Bm7
         but nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
             Em7                  A7
         and he never gives an answer


[Chorus 1]

                  Dm  Bb/D  Dm            Bb/D
         but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
                 C7                         Dm              Dm7   D6
         and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round


[Verse 2]

         D6                   Em/D
         well on his way, his head in a cloud
             D6                               Em/D
         the man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
             Em7         A7                  D6                 Bm7
         but nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make
             Em7                 A7
         and he never seems to notice


[Chorus 2]

                  Dm  Bb/D  Dm            Bb/D
         but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
                 C7                         Dm              Dm7   D6
         and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round

         and nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
             Em7                A7
         and he never shows his feelings


[Chorus 3]

         and he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fool
         Em7           A7
            they don't like him
