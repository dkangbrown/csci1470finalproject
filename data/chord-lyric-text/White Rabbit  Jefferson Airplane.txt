[Verse 1]

F#                            G
One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small
         F#                                 G
and the ones that mother gives you don't do anything at all
       A      C          D        A
go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall


[Verse 2]

F#                                      G
And if you go chasing rabbits and you know you're going to fall
           F#                             G
Tell'em a hooka smoking caterpillar has given you the cord
       A    C   D              A
Call Alice when she was just small


[Bridge]

E                                      A
When men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go
         E                                       A
and you just had some kind of mushroom and your mind is moving low
        F#            
go ask Alice, I think she'll know


[Verse 3]

F#                             G
When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead
         F#                                 
and the white knight is talking backwards 
              G
and the red queen's off with her head
  A      C          D         A
Remember   what the Dormouse said
E         A       E         A
Feed your head! Feed your head!
E         A
Feed your head!
