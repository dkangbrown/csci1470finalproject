[Intro]

Em Em Em Em, F F F F (6x) (staccato strumming, all downstrokes) 


[Verse 1] 

Em                    F
London calling to the faraway towns
    G
Now war is declared, and battle come down
Em                    F
London calling to the underworld
G
Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
Em                  F
London calling, now don't look to us
G
Phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust
Em                     F
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
G
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing


[Chorus 1]

Em                        G
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Em                     G
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Em                       G
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
Em                             D (let ring)
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river


[Verse 2]

Em                    F
London calling to the imitation zone
G
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
Em                    F
London calling to the zombies of death
G
Quit holding out, and draw another breath
Em                    F
London calling, and I don't wanna shout
    G
But while we were talking, I saw you nodding out
Em                     F
London calling, see we ain't got no high
G
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes


[Chorus 2] 

Em                         G
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Em                        G
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
Em                   G
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Em                             D (let ring)
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river


[Interlude] 

Em F G (4x) Play the same as the verse


[Chorus 2] 

Em                         G
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Em                        G
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
Em                   G
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Em                             D (let ring)
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river


[Intro] 4x

[Verse 3] Guitar and bass same as the intro

Em                   F
London calling, yes, I was there, too
Em                           F
An' you know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
Em                    F
London calling at the top of the dial
Em              F
After all this, won't you give me a smile?
Em                   F
London calling
Em                   F

Em
I never felt so much alike [fading] alike alike alike
