          G
I've been worked by the rain

Driven by the snow

Drunk and dirty - don't you know?
        G    C  G
But I'm still,  willin

            G
(And I was) Out on the road

Late at night,

Seen my pretty Alice, in every headlight
G    C        G
Alice, Dallas Alice

Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made;

I'll be willin', to be movin'

Kicked by the wind,
D
Robbed by the sleet
       Em                      C
Had my head stoved in, but I'm still on my feet

And I'm still     Willin'

G                                                           D
Smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Em
Baked by the sun
C                  G       C       G
Every time I go to Mexico, but Im willin
