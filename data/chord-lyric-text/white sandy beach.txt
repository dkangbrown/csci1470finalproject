F (4)
I saw you in my dream, we were walking hand in hand
     Bb          Bbm        F      C7
On a white sandy beach of Hawai段

We were playing in the sun, we were having so much fun
   Bb          Bbm        F (2)
On a white sandy beach of Hawai段

C7 (2)             Bb                  C7
Sound of the ocean soothes my restless soul
C7 (5) 
Sound of the ocean rocks me all night long  

      F (4)
Those hot long summer days, lying there in the sun
      Bb          Bbm        F (2)
On a white sandy beach of Hawai段

[Chorus]
C7 (2)             Bb                  C7
Sound of the ocean soothes my restless soul

Sound of the ocean rocks me all night long

Last night in my dream, I saw your face again
        Bb           Bbm (4)                          F (2)
We were there in the sun, on a white sandy beach of Hawai段

On a white sandy beach of Hawai段
