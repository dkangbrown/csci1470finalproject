Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
    Dm       C
and think of you
Dm     C     Dm  C      Dm C
Caught up in circles confusion,
   Dm      C
is nothing new
F    G    Em   F
Flashback warm nights;
  G           Em
almost left behind
F   G       Em   F
Suitcase of memories,
     G
time after . .  

Dm  C         Dm      C
Sometimes you picture me, 
    Dm  C       Dm   C
I'm walking too far ahead
Dm     C       Dm C     Dm    C
You're calling to me, I can't hear,
     Dm     C
what you ve said 
     F   G   Em F
Then you say go slow; 
  G      Em
I fall behind 
    F  G   Em     F
The second hand unwinds

          G                              Am
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
F    G     C
time after time
       G                             Am
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting;
F    G     C
time after time
          G                              Am
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
F    G     C
time after time
       G                               Am
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting; 
F    G     C
time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has, 
Dm        C
turned to gray
Dm   C           D  C           Dm    C
Watching through windows you're wondering,
   Dm   C
if I'm OK
F   G   Em F  G            Em
Secrets stolen from deep inside;
    F    G     Em     F
the drum beats out of time 

          G                              Am
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
