G                                                    F
I was alone I took a ride I didn't know what I would find there
G                                                  F
Another road where maybe I can see another kind of mind there

Bm          D
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Bm         D 
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
C            Am  D     G
Every single day of my life

G                                                       F
You didn't run you didn't lie you know I wanted just to hold you
G                                                             F
And had you gone you'd knew in time we meet again for I'd had told you

Ooh you were meant to be near me

G                                                      F
What can I do? What can I be when I'm with you I wanna stay there
G                                                   F
If I'm true I'll never leave and if I do I know the way there
Bm                  D

I didn't know what I would find there
 F                                                   G
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

     F
Then suddenly I see you,
      G
Did I tell you I need you . . .
