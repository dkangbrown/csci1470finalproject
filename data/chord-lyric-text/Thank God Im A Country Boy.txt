[Root] A

     A                            D
Well life on a farm is kinda laid back
      A                            G        E
Ain't much an old country boy like me can�t hack
     A              E            D
It's early to rise, early in the sack
      A         E        A
Thank God I'm a country boy
  A                                   D
A simple kind of life never did me no harm
A                       G            E
Raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm
   A                           E            D
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
      A         E       A
Thank God I'm a country boy

CHORUS
       E                     A
Well I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
         E                     A
When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
    A          E             D
And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
      A         E       A
Thank God I'm a country boy

MUSIC BEGINS
         A                                     D
When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low
  A                        G             E
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin' up the bow
        A                    E             D
But the kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
      A         E       A
Thank God I'm a country boy
A                                    D
I'd play "Sally Goodin" all day if I could
        A                         G            E
But the lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
     A                       E           D
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
      A         E       A
Thank God I'm a country boy

  A                                      D
I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
  A                     G            E
I never was one of them money-hungry fools
    A                            E       D
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
      A         E       A
Thank God I'm a country boy

     A                                 D
Yeah city folk drivin� in a black limousine
        A                   G             E
A lotta sad people thinkin' that's mighty keen
      A                         E            D
Well, son let me tell you now exactly what I mean
        A         E       A
I thank God I'm a country boy

         A                                     D
Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
       A                              G             E
And he took me by the hand and held me close to his side
          A                            E           D
He said: "Live a good life and play my fiddle with pride
          A            E        A
And thank God you're a country boy

         A                                      D
My daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle 
   A                                G           E
He taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
   A                                E           D
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
              A         E       A
Spoken: Thank God I�m a country boy
