[Root] G


[Verse 1]

G     C                         D    C
Some people call me the space cowboy yeah
G     C                       D     C
Some call me the gangster of love
G      C                D   C 
Some people call me Maurice
          G              C           D    C
Cause' I speak of the pompetous of love


[Verse 2]

G  C             D           C    
   People talk about me baby
G         C                   D          C
Say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong
G   C                D           C
But don't you worry baby don't worry
            G                       C                    D   C
Cause' I'm right here, right here, right here, right at home


[Chorus]

              G              C
Cause' I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
       G                C
I'm a lover, And I'm a sinner
G           C            D   C 
playin' my music in the sun
        G            C
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
       G           C
I'm a mid-night toker
G          C            D
I get my lovin' on the run, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


[Verse 3]

G        C                    D          C
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
  G                 C               D          C
I really love your peaches want to shake your tree
G      C                         D             C
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
G          C           D              C
Ooh wee baby, I sure show you a good time


[Chorus]

              G              C
Cause' I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
       G                C
I'm a lover, And I'm a sinner
G           C            D   C 
playin' my music in the sun
        G            C
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
       G           C
I'm a mid-night toker
G            C               D          
I sure don't want to hurt no one, Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
