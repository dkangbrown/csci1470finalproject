[Root] G

                   G  C                   G
Don't rock the jukebox I wanna hear some Jones
                       G                      D
'Cause my heart ain't ready for the Rolling Stones
                   G     C                 G
I don't feel like rockin' since my baby's gone
 C                 G     D                 G
So don't rock the jukebox play me a country song


[Verse]

                      C                         G
Before you drop that quarter keep one thing in mind
                      A                          D
You got a heartbroke hillbilly standing here in line
                    C                     G   C
I've been down and lonely ever since she left
                       G    D                    G
Before you punch that number could I make one request


[Chorus]

                   G  C                   G
Don't rock the jukebox I wanna hear some Jones
                       G                      D
'Cause my heart ain't ready for the Rolling Stones
                   G     C                 G
I don't feel like rockin' since my baby's gone
 C                 G     D                 G
So don't rock the jukebox play me a country song


[Verse]

             C                      G
I ain't got nothing against rock & roll
                             A                            D
But when your heart's been broken you need a song that's slow
                             C                        G   C
There ain't nothin' like a steel guitar to drown a memory
                       G          D              G
Before you spend your money babe play a song for me


[Chorus]    

                   G  C                     G
Don't rock the jukebox I wanna hear George Jones
                G                      D
My heart ain't ready for the Rolling Stones
                   G     C                 G
I don't feel like rockin' since my baby's gone
 C                 G     D                 G     C
So don't rock the jukebox play me a country song
                   G     D                  G
So don't rock the jukebox play me a country song
