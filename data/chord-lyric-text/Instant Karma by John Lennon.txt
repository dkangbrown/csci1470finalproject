[Root] A

[verse 1]

A                         F#m
Instant karma's gonna get you
A                         F#m
Gonna knock you right in the head
A                         F#m
You better get yourself together,
F                   G          A
Pretty soon your gonna be dead
D                               Bm
What in the world you thinking of?
D                        Bm
Laughing in the face of love
C                             Am
What on earth you tryin' to do?
 D
Its up to you
 E7
Yeah you


[Verse 2]

Instant Karma's Gonna get you
Gonna look you right in the face
Better get yourself together darlin'
Join the Human Race
How in the world you gonna see?
Laughing at fools like me
Who on earth do you think you are?
A superstar?
Well right you are


[Chorus]

        G   Bm   Em
Well we all shine on
        G             Bm            Em
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
        G   Bm   Em
Well we all shine on
D          E7
Ev'ry one, come on.


[verse 3]

Instant karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you off your feet
Better recognise your brothers
Ev'ry one you meet
Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear?
Why on earth are you there?
When you're everywhere gonna get your share


[Chorus]

        G   Bm   Em
Well we all shine on
        G             Bm            Em
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
        G   Bm   Em
Well we all shine on
D          E7
Ev'ry one, come on.


[Middle]

A         F#m

 A       F#m
Alright
 A      F#m
Ah ha,
 F   G   A
Ah!


[Chorus] (Repeat chorus 3 times to fade)

        G   Bm   Em
Well we all shine on
        G             Bm            Em
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
        G   Bm   Em
Well we all shine on
D          E7
Ev'ry one, come on.
