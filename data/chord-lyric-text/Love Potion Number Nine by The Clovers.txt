[Root] Am

Am                         Dm
I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
Am                           Dm
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
C                                         Am
She's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Dm                        E                  Am
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine

Am                      Dm
I told her that I was a flop with chicks
Am                         Dm
I've been this way since 1956
C                                          Am
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
Dm                         E                  Am
She said "What you need is Love Potion Number Nine"

    Dm
She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
    B7
She said "I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink"
   Dm
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like Indian ink
  E
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

Am                      Dm
I didn't know if it was day or night
Am                     Dm
I started kissin' everything in sight
C                                                 Am
But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Dm                           E                  Am
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

    Dm
She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
    B7
She said "I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink"
   Dm
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like Indian ink
  E
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

Am                      Dm
I didn't know if it was day or night
Am                     Dm
I started kissin' everything in sight
C                                                 Am
But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Dm                           E                  Am
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

Dm                 Am
