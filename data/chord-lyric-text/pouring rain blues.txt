         A              D
Well I'm sittin' on the front porch
         A              D
got my guitar just playin' around
         A      A/G     F#7
I'm gonna strum this here guitar
D            E
til the rain stops pouring down


         A              D
Well I'm sittin' on the front porch
         A              D
    the rain is falling down
A             A/G            F#7
    I'm gonna play this damn guitar
D                           E
til the sun comes back around

You know I've felt bad, yes it's true
And you know I've felt blue
But on the other side of that lonliness
The sun is gonna shine through

So let it rain and let it pour
Got the pouring rain blues
I'll pass the time with some tender lines
Chase those blues away

There's water down in the basement
And I've had no luck keeping dry
I don't wanna drown in that lonliness
In fact I'd rather die

So even when rain is gone and the clouds have parted
And everythibg seems so fine
I know someday them pouring rain blues
gonna come back another time

So let it rain and let it pour
Chase my pouring rain blues away
I'll pass the time with some tender lines
Live to fight another day

So let it rain and let it pour
there's nothing I can do
I'll pass the time with some tender lines
I'll play my guitar just for you
