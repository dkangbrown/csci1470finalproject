[Root] G

[Verse 1]

                             G
He said I'll love you til I die
                              C
She told him you'll forget in time
                         D
As the years went slowly by
                           G
She still preyed upon his mind
                            G
He kept her picture on his wall
                         C
Went half crazy now and then
                               D
He still loved her through it all
                         G
Hoping she'd come back again


[Verse 2]

                          G
Kept some letters by his bed
          C
and in 1962
                      D
He had underlined in red
                     G
Every single I love you

                          G
I went to see him just today
                         C
Oh but I didn't see no tears
                      D
All dressed up to go away
                                   G
First time I'd seen him smile in years


[Chorus]

                                G
   He stopped loving her today
                        G7             C
        They placed a wreath upon his door
                                    D7
        And soon they'll carry him away
                                 G
        He stopped loving her today


[Verse 3]

                                       G
You know she came to see him one last time
                                C
Oh and we all wondered if she would
                                D
And it kept running through my mind
                             G
This time he's over her for good


[Chorus]

                                G
   He stopped loving her today
                        G7             C
        They placed a wreath upon his door
                                    D7
        And soon they'll carry him away
                                 G
        He stopped loving her today
                                       G
You know she came to see him one last time
                                C
Oh and we all wondered if she would
                                D
And it kept running through my mind
                             G
This time he's over her for good
