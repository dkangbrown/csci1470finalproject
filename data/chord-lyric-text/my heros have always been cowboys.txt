[Root] D

    D
1. I grew up dreaming of being a cowboy
2. Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery

       G                 D
1. And loving the cowboy ways.
2. From being alone too long.

    D
1. Pursuing the life of my high riding heroes
2. You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare

     E7                                 A7
1. I   burned   up   my    childhood    days.
2. Knowing well that your best days are gone

     D
1. I learned all the rules of a moder day drifter
2. Picking up hookers instead of my pen

             G                      D
1. DonUt you hold on to nothing too long
2. I let the words of my youth fade away.

        G                           D            G
1. Just take what you need from the ladies and   leave them
2.      Old worn out saddles and    old worm out memories

            D          A7          D
1. With the words of a sad country song.
2.     With no one and no place to stay.

CHORUS
   G                       D
My heroes have always been cowboys
E7                    A7
And they still are it seems
G                      D           G
Sadly in search of and one step in back of
    D                A7          D
Themselves and their slow moving dreams.

This song is in 3/4 time. It sounds best if you hit the bass note of the
chord on the first beat of each measure. You might want to put in some bass
runs like A-B-C#-D between A and D chords where it sounds right.
