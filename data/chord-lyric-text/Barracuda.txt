[Verse]

   E                                      C
     So this ain't the end - I saw you again today
                                 E
     I had to turn my heart away
                                           C
     Smile like the Sun - kisses for ev'ry one
                          E
     and tales - it never fails!


[Chorus]
                  C                    E
        You lying so low in the weeds
          C                        E
        I bet you gonna ambush me
                      D                            A
        You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
                 (tacet)       E           F#  G
        Now wouldn't you, Barracuda?


[Verse]

     E                                          C
     Back over time when we were all trying for free
                                      E
     you met up with porpoise and me
                                            C
     No right, no wrong; selling a song - a name
             E
     Whisper game.


[Chorus]
                   C                             E
        And if the real thing don't do the trick
                   C                        E
        You better make up something quick
                  D                                A
        You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
                   E
        Oooh, Barracuda?


[Bridge]

      C
     "Sell me sell you" the porpoise said
     A                                        E
     Dive down deep, now.  Save my head. You ...

     I think that you got the blues too.
     C
     All that night and all the next
     A
     Swam without looking back
                          E
     Made for the western pools -- silly, silly fools.


[Chorus]
                   C                             E
        And if the real thing don't do the trick
                   C                        E
        You better make up something quick
                  D                                A
        You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
                   E
        Oooh, Barracuda?
