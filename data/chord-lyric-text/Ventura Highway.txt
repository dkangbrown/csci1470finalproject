Intro: F                Cmaj7

{Verse 1]
F                                           Cmaj7  
Chewin' on a piece of grass walkin' down the road 
F                                          Cmaj7  
   tell   me,   how   long   you   gonna     stay here Joe? 
F                                           Cmaj7  
Some  people  say  this  town  don't  look   good in snow 
F                                          Cmaj7  
   You   don't   care,                       I know. 

[Chorus]
F                   Cmaj7 
Ventura Highway, in the  sunshine 
          F                                            Cmaj7 
Where the days are longer  The nights are stronger than moonshine 
F                       Cmaj7
   You're gonna go         I know  ooo-oh  ooo-o-ooo-oh  ooo-oh ooo-o-ooo-oh 
          Dm7                  Em
Cause the free wind is blowin' through your hair
        Dm7                Em
And the day surrounds your daylight there
Dm7               Em
 Season's crying, no despair
    Dm7            Em                Fmaj7 
Alligator, lizards in the air, in the air

 
Cmaj7                F 
Doo Do Doo   Doo Do Doo


{Verse 2]
F                                          Cmaj7  
Wishin' on a fallin' star   Waitin' for the  early train 
F                                           Cmaj7  
Sorry   boy,   but   I've  been   hit   by   purple rain 
F                                           Cmaj7  
Aw,  come on  Joe,    you   can   always     change your name 
F                                           Cmaj7 
Thanks    alot     son,      just    the     same 


[Repeat Chorus]

Cmaj7                F 
Doo Do Doo   Doo Do Doo
