[Root] C

C          Em              F         C
You can take� all the tea in China
               Em            F         G
Put it in a big brown� bag for me
C             Em               F           
Sail right around� all the seven oceans
C             Em               F          C
Drop it straight into the deep blue sea

(same chord progression throughout)

She's as sweet as Tupelo honey

She's an angel of the first degree

She's as sweet as Tupelo honey

Just like honey from the bee

You can't stop us on the road to freedom

You can't keep us 'cause our eyes can see

Men with insight, men in granite

Knights in armor bent on chivalry 

CHORUS __> SOLO

You can't stop us on the road to freedom

You can't keep us 'cause our eyes can see

Men with insight, men in granite

Knights in armor bent on chivalry

CHORUS
