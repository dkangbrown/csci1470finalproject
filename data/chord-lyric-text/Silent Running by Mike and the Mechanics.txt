INTRO: Dm  C  Bb 2x 
 
         Dm   C           Bb               
 Can you hear me, can you hear me running?  
         Dm                       C               Bb

VERSE: 
Dm                 C                Bb  
 Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar 
    Dm               C                Bb 
 By now the fighting will be close at hand 
Dm                 C                    Bb 
 Don?t believe the church and state and everything they tell you 
   Dm               C             Bb 
 Believe in me, I?m with the high command 
         Dm   C           Bb               
 Can you hear me, can you hear me running?  
         Dm                       C               Bb 
 Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?   
         Dm   C           Bb               
 Can you hear me, can you hear me running?  
         Dm                       C               Bb

VERSE: 
 Dm                C          Bb                               
 There?s a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway 
 Dm          C         Bb     
 Use it only in emergency  
 Dm                C               Bb 
 Better you should pray to god the father and the spirit  
      Dm            C               Bb 
 Will guide you and protect from up here 
 
RPEAT Chorus: 
 
LEAD BREAK:  SAME CHORD 
 
VERSE: 
                      
 Swear allegiance to the flag whatever flag they offer 

 Never hint at what you really feel 

 Teach the children quietly for some day sons and daughters 

 Will rise up and fight while we stood still
