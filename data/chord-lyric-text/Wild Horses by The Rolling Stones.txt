[Root] G

Bm        G       Bm         G
Childhood living  is easy to do
Am               C     D G                  D
The things that  you wanted  I bought them  for you
Bm        G    Bm             G
Graceless lady you know who I am
Am               C      D G             D
You know I can't let you  slide from my hand


[Chorus]

Am    C    D  G        F       C
Wild horses   couldn't drag me away
Am        C     D   G        F       C      G
Wild wild horses    couldn't drag me away


[Verse 2]

Bm            G      Bm            G
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Am          C     D G              D
Now you've decided  to show me the same
Bm          G     Bm            G
No sweeping exits or offstage lights
Am                 C     D  G               D
Can make me feel bitter   or treat you unkind


[Chorus]

Am    C    D  G        F       C
Wild horses   couldn't drag me away
Am         C    D   G        F        C
Wild wild horses    couldn't drag me away

Bm          G            Bm          G
Am       C      D   G                     D


[Ending]

Bm       G           Bm          G
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
Am        C      D     G                     D 
I have my freedom      but I don't have much time
Bm             G      Bm            G
Faith has been broken tears must be cried
Am            C     D    G        D
Let's do some living     after we die

Am    C    D  G        F        C
Wild horses   couldn't drag me away
Am        C    D   G     F              C
Wild wild horses   we'll ride them some day

Am    C    D  G        F        C
Wild horses   couldn't drag me away
Am        C    D   G     F              C  D   G
Wild wild horses   we'll ride them some day
