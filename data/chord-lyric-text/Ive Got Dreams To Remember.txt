Honey I saw you there last night
A
Another mans arms holding you tight
E
Nobody knows what I feeled inside
A                    E
All I know, I walked away and cried


E
I know you said he was just a friend
A
But I saw him kiss you again and again
E
These eyes of mine, they don't fool me
A                   E
Why did he hold you so tenderly?

E
I still want you to stay
F#
I still love you anyway
D
I still don't want you to ever leav
   E
Girl, you just satisfy me! [Ooh-Wee!]
