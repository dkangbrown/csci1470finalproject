D              F
Old man look at my life,
C              
Twenty four
G
And there's so much more
D                  F
Live alone in a paradise
C                       F
That makes me think of two.

D                  F
Love lost, such a cost,
C
Give me things
G
That don't get lost.
D                       C
Like a coin that won't get tossed
F              G
Rolling home to you.

Lullabies, look in your eyes,

Run around the same old town.
D                        F
Doesn't mean that much to me
C                      F
To mean that much to you.


D                   F
I've been first and last
C                          G
Look at how the time goes past.
D                      C
But I'm all alone at last.

Rolling home to you.
