[Root] A

I've been run down,  and I've been lied to,

And I don't know why I let that mean woman make me a fool.

She took all my money,  wrecked my new car,

Now she's with one of my good time buddies

Drinkin in some cross town bar


[Chorus]

       D7                   E7
Sometimes I feel,    sometimes I feel,
               A           D        C
Like I've been tied to the whippin' post
A           D        C
Tied to the whippin' post,
A           D        C
Tied to the whippin' post,
C    Tacet
Good lord I feel like I'm dying.


[Verse]

My friends tell me   that I've been such a fool,

And I have to stand by and take if, baby, all for loving you.

Drown myself in sorrow  and I look at what you've done,

But nothing seems to change, the bad times stay the same

And I can't go on


[Chorus]

        D7                   E7
Sometimes I feel,    sometimes I feel,
               A           D        C
Like I've been tied to the whippin' post
A           D        C
Tied to the whippin' post,
A           D        C
Tied to the whippin' post,
C    Tacet
Good lord I feel like I'm dying.
