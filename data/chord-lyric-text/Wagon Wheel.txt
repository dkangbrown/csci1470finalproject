[Verse]

G                         D
Heading down south to the land of the pines
Em                       C
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
G                       D                 C 
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
G                           D
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Em                      C
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
          G                        D              C
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight


[Chorus]

   G                    D 
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Em                C
Rock me momma any way you feel
G   D       C
Hey,  momma rock me
G                      D
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Em                   C
Rock me momma like a south bound train
G   D       C
Hey,  momma rock me

[Verse]

G                     D
Running from the cold up in New England
      Em                         C
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
   G                    D              C
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
    G                            D
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
          Em                       C
I lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
      G                     D                    C  
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more


[Chorus]

   G                    D 
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Em                C
Rock me momma any way you feel
G   D       C
Hey,  momma rock me
G                      D
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Em                   C
Rock me momma like a south bound train
G   D       C
Hey,  momma rock me

[Verse]

G                    D
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
           Em                          C
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
    G                            D
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
   C 
To Johnson City, Tennessee
      G                   D
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
          Em                         C
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
    G                       D                C
And if I died in Raleigh at least I will die free


[Chorus]

(no chord)
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel

Rock me momma any way you feel

Hey,  momma rock me

Rock me momma like the wind and the rain

Rock me momma like a south bound train
                     C
Hey,  momma rock me
   G                    D 
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Em                C
Rock me momma any way you feel
G   D       C
Hey,  momma rock me
G                      D
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Em                   C
Rock me momma like a south bound train
G   D       C        G  D  Em  C
Hey,  momma rock me
