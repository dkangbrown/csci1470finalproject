[Intro]

 C    G/B   Am    


[Verse]

C              G/B               Am           
I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you 
F           G    
In worn out shoes
C                   G/B              Am          
With silver hair, a ragged shirt, and baggy pants
F            G    
The old soft shoe 
F            Em              Am    
He jumped so high, jumped so high
D7              G7        
Then he lightly touched down

C              G/B               Am       
I met him in a cell in New Orleans I was 
F        G  
down and out
C                G/B          Am
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
F                 G  
as he spoke right out 
F            Em              Am   D7
He talked of life, talked of life, he laughed
                      G7      
clicked his heels and stepped
 
C                 G/B               Am          
He said his name "Bojangles" and he danced a lick 
F          G    
across the cell
C                        G/B                            Am   
He grabbed his pants and spread his stance,Oh he jumped so high 
F                       G    
and then he clicked his heels 
F           Em              Am
He let go a laugh, let go a laugh
D7                             G7 
and shook back his clothes all around


[Chorus]

Am    G        Am     G
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Am    G        C     G/B  Am 
Mr. Bojangles, dance


[Verse]

C                 G/B               Am           
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
F          G   
throughout the south
C                        G/B                            Am  
He spoke through tears of 15 years how his dog and him
F                       G     
traveled about
F           Em              Am
The dog up and died, he up and died
D7                             G7 
And after 20 years he still grieves 

C                 G/B               Am           
He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
F          G  
for drinks and tips
C                        G/B                            Am   
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
F                       G
'cause I drinks a bit
F           Em              Am
He shook his head, and as he shook his head
D7                             G7 
I heard someone ask him please 


[Chorus]

Am    G        Am     G
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Am    G        C     G/B  Am 
Mr. Bojangles, dance
