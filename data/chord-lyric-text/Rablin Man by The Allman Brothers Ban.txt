[Root] G

G           F       C      G
Lord I was born a Ramblin' man
G                            C             D
Tryin' to make a living and doing the best I can
C                     G       Em           C
When it's time for leaving I hope you'll understand
G           D              G
That I was born a Ramblin' man

G                F               G         
My father was a Gambler down in Gorgia
G                    C            D
He wound up on the wrong end of a gun
C                     G               Em       C
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
G               D           G
Rolling down highway forty-one


[Chorus]

G           F       C      G
Lord I was born a Ramblin' man
G                            C             D
Tryin' to make a living and doing the best I can
C                     G       Em           C
When it's time for leaving I hope you'll understand
G           D              G
That I was born a Ramblin' man

G                         C         D
I'm on my way to New Orleans this morning
G                 C            D
Leavin' out of Nashville, Tennessee
C                        G                     Em      C 
they're always havin' a good time down on the Bayou, lord
G                  D                G
Them delta women think the world of me


[Chorus]

G           F       C      G
Lord I was born a Ramblin' man
G                            C             D
Tryin' to make a living and doing the best I can
C                     G       Em           C
When it's time for leaving I hope you'll understand
G           D              G
That I was born a Ramblin' man

[Outro]

G           F       C      G
Lord I was born a Ramblin' man
G           F       C      G
Lord I was born a Ramblin' man
G           F       C      G
Lord I was born a Ramblin' man
G           F       C      G
Lord I was born a Ramblin' man
