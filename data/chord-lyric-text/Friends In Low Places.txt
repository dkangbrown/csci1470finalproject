[Root] A


[Verse] 

               A
  Blame it all on my roots
           Bbdim7
         I showed up in boots
           Bm
       And ruined your black tie affair
           E
       The last one to know
           E7
       The last one to show
           A
 I was the last one you thought you'd see there
           A
     And I saw the surprise
           Bbdim7
   And the fear in his eyes
           Bm                      Dm
      When I took his glass of champagne
           E
           I toasted you
           E7
Said honey we may be through
           E
       But you'll never hear me 
           E7
       Complain


[Chorus]

           A
    'Cause I got friends in low places
           A
 Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
           Bm
       My blues away
           E
  And I'll be okay
           A
           I'm not big on social graces
           A
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
           Bm              E
    'Cause I've got friends 
           A
   In low places


[Verse]

           A
    Well I guess I was wrong
           Bbdim7
         I just don't belong
           Bm
       But then, I've been there before
           E
      Everything's alright
           E7
      I'll just say goodnight
           A
  And I'll show myself to the door
           A
       Hey I didn't mean 
           Bbdim7
        To cause a big scene
           Bm                  Dm
      Just give me an hour and then
           E
           I'll be as high as that
           E7
           Ivory tower
           E
            That you're livin'
           E7
           in


[Chorus]

                  A
         I guess I was wrong 
           Bbdim7
         I just don't belong 
           Bm
       But then, I've been there before 
           E
  And everything's alright 
           E7
      I'll just say goodnight 
           A
  And I'll show myself to the door 
           A
           I didn't mean 
           Bbdim7
        To cause a big scene 
           Bm                      Dm
      Just wait 'til I finish this glass 
           E
      Then sweet little lady
           E7
 I'll head back to the bar 
           E
            And you can 
           E7
   Kiss my ass!


[Chorus]
