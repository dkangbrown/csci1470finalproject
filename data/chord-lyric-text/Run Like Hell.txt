[Verse]
          Fm
You better make your face up in
Your favourite disguise
          F#
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
          Fm
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
         Db
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
          B7
With your nerves in tatters
When the cockleshell shatters
        E
And the hammers batter
Down your door
           D        Dm
You better run

Run, run,  run, run,   run, run, run, run


[Verse]
Eb
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
          F
You better run all day
And run all night
              F#
And keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside. And if you're
F
Taking your girlfriend
Out tonight,
    Fm     Db
You better park the car
Well out of sight
             B7
'Cos if they catch you in the backseat
Trying to pick her locks
              E
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
           D
You better run.
