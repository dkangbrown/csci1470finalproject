 G            C
 When I was a little bitty boy
    D                       G
 my grandmother bought me a cute little toy
 G                    C
 Silver bells hangin' on a string
     D                 G
 she told me it was my ding a ling

 G               C
 My ding a ling, my ding a ling
 D                   G
 I want to play with my ding a ling
 G               C
 My ding a ling, my ding a ling
   D                 G
 I want to play with my ding a ling


     G                      C
 And then mother took me to Grammer School
     D                    G
 But I stopped all in the vestibule
 G               C
 Every time that bell would ring
 D                       G
 catched me playin' with my ding a ling

 G               C
 My ding a ling, my ding a ling
 D                   G
 I want to play with my ding a ling
 G               C
 My ding a ling, my ding a ling
   D                 G
 I want to play with my ding a ling

 G                       C
 Once I was climbing the garden wall
   D                 G
 I slipped and had a terrible fall
   G              C
 I fell so hard I heard bells ring
     D          G
 but held on to my ding a ling

 G               C
 My ding a ling, my ding a ling
 D                   G
 I want to play with my ding a ling
 G               C
 My ding a ling, my ding a ling
   D                 G
 I want to play with my ding a ling

 G                         C
 Once I was swimming cross Turtle creek
 D                  G
 many snappers all around my feet
 G                       C
 Shure was hard swimming cross that thing
      D                  G
 with both hands holdin' my ding a ling
 

 G               C
 My ding a ling, my ding a ling
 D                   G
 I want to play with my ding a ling
 G               C
 My ding a ling, my ding a ling
   D                 G
 I want to play with my ding a ling

 G                 C
 This here song it ain't so sad
     D                      G
 the cutest little song you ever had
 G                C
 those of you who will not sing
     D                         G
 You must be playin' with your own ding a ling

 G                C
 Your ding a ling Your ding a ling
    D                    G
 We saw you playin' with your ding a ling
 G              C
 My ding a ling everybody sing
   D                 G
 I want to play with my ding a ling
