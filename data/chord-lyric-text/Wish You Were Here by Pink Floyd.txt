[Verse 1]

C                         D
So, so you think you can tell,

             Am                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.

                     D                       C                    Am
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,

                      G
Do you think you can tell?


[Verse 2]

                          C                   D
And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,

                Am                    G                             D
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,

                  C                        Am                         G
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

[Verse 3]

C                               D
How I wish, how I wish you were here.

           Am                                     G                  D
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,

                                  C
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?

             Am                         G
The same old fears. Wish you were here!
