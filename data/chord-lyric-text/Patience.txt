[Verse 1]

C
Shed a tear cause I'm missing you
G
I'm still alright to smile
A                            D       Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
Girl I think about you every day now
C
Was a time when I wasn't sure
        G
But you set my mind at ease
A                               D        Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
There is no doubt, you're in my heart now

C          G
Sad woman take it slow
        C               Em
It will work itself out fine
C              G               D     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
All we need is just a little patience
C          G
Sad sugar make it slow and
   C              Em
It comes together fine

[Verse 2]

C
Sit here on the stairs
         G
Cause I'd rather be alone
   A
If I can't have you right now
      D       Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
I'll wait dear
C
Sometimes I get so tense
      G
But I can't speed up the time
    A
But�you know love, there's one more thing
       D   Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
To consider

[Chorus]

C         G
Sad woman take it slow
    C                    Em
And things will be just fine
C                 G             D      Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
You and I�ll just use a little patience
C         G
Sad sugar take the time
           C                   Em
Cause the lights are shining bright
C              G               D      Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
You and I got what it takes to make it
D               Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
We don't fake it
D                     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D  
Ahh and never break it
D                    Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
Cause I can't take it

I've been walking the streets tonight

Just trying to get it right
