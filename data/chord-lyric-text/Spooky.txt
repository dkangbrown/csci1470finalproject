In the cool of the evenin' when ev'rything is gettin' kind of groovy
Em7                           A13                               Em7       A13
I call you up and ask you if you'd like to go with me and see a movie
Em7
First you say "No", you've got some plans for the night
             A13                 A#dim7
And then you stop, and say, "All right"
Em7                        A13                     Em7   Bm7
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you.

You always keep me guessin', I never seem to know what you are thinkin'

And if some fellow looks at you, it's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'
Em7
I get confused, 'cause I don't know where I stand
             A13        A#dim7
And then you smile, and hold my hand

If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playin'
E#m7                           A#13                       E#m7       A#13

Just like a ghost, you've been a-hauntin' my dreams
