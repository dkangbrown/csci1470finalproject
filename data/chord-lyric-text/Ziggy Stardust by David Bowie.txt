[Verse 1]

G
 Now Ziggy played guitar,
Bm                            C
  Jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
           B    C    D
And the Spiders from Mars.
                       G
He played it left hand,
(G)                 Em
But made it too far.
               A
Became the special man,
             C
Then we were Ziggy's band.


[Verse 2]


Ziggy really sang,
screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo,
              B    C D
like some cat from Japan.
He could lick 'em by smiling,
he could leave them to hang.
They came on so loaded, man,
well hung, snow white tan....


[Chorus]

Am    G5              F5    G5 Am
  So where were the spiders,
(Am)      G5                F5         G5 Am
While the fly tried to break our balls?
(Am)        G5           F5
Just the beer light to guide us,
(F5) G5 D                 Dsus2
 so  we bitched about his fans
D             E
and should we crush his sweet hands?


[Interlude]

[Verse 3]

Ziggy played for time,
Jiving us that we were voodoo.
The kids were just crass,
He was the nazz,
With God given ass.
He took it all too far,
But, boy, Could he play guitar!


[Chorus 2]

Making love to his ego,
Ziggy sucked up into his mind,
Like a leper Messiah,
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band!

Yeah...         ooo.... 
Cadd9           G
ZIGGY PLAYED GUITAR!
