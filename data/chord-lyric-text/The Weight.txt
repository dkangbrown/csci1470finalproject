A               C#m             D                       A
I pulled in to Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead.
A                 C#m        D             A
I just need some place where I can lay my head.
A                      C#m             D                A
"Hey, Mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
A                  C#m           D               A
He just grinned, shook my hand, "No" was all he said.


[Chorus]

A      A/G#       D
Take a load off, Fanny.
A      A/G#       D
Take a load for free.
A      A/G#       D
Take a load off, Fanny.
D                                  A
And...  you put the load right on me.

A               C#m             D                       A
I picked up my bag.  I went looking for a place to hide.
A                 C#m        D             A
When I saw Carmen and the devil walking side by side.
A                      C#m             D                A
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on. Let's go downtown."
A                  C#m           D               A
She said, "I got to go, but my friend can stick around."

Take a load off, Fanny.
D                                  A
And...  you put the load right on me.

A                  C#m        D             A
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say.
A                 C#m        D             A
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgement day.
A                 C#m        D             A
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
A                   C#m           D                A
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company."

Take a load off, Fanny.

And...  you put the load right on me.

A                   C#m           D                A
Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog.
A                   C#m           D                A
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack my dog."
A                   C#m           D                A
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester. You know I'm a peaceful man."
A                   C#m           D                A
He said, "That's okay, boy.  Won't you feed him when you can?"

A                   C#m           D                A
Get your Canonball now, to take me down the line.
A                   C#m           D                A
My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time
A                   C#m           D                A
To get back to Miss Fanny.  You know she's the only one
A                   C#m           D                A
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone.


[Chorus]

A      A/G#       D
Take a load off, Fanny.
A      A/G#       D
Take a load for free.

Take a load off, Fanny.
D                                  A
And...  you put the load right on me.
