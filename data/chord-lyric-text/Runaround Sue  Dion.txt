[Root] D
D
Here's my story, it's sad but true
Bm
It's about a girl that I once knew
G
She took my love, then ran around
A
With every single guy in town


[Interlude]

D
Hey, hey, um-da-da-da-di-di       
Bm                            
Hey, hey, um-da-da-da-di-di  
G                            
Hey, hey, um-da-da-da-di-di   
A                             
Hey, hey, oooooooooohhhhh


[Verse 2]

D
I guess I should have known it from the very start
Bm
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
G
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A
"I keep away from Runaround Sue"


[Verse 3]

D
Her amazing lips and the smile from her face
Bm
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
G
So if you don't want to cry like I do
A
Keep away from Runaround Sue.


[Bridge]

G
She like to travel around
D
She'll love you, then she'll put you down
G
Now, people let me put you wise
A
She goes out with other guys


[Verse 5]

D
And the moral of the story from the guy who knows
Bm
I've been in love and my love still grows
G
Ask any fool that she ever knew
A
they'll say: Keep away from Runaround Sue
