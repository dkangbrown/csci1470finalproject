[Verse 1]

          A      E      F#m   A/G    
There are places I'll remember
       D Dm        A
All my life though some have changed
        A    E       F#m    A/G 
Some forever not for better
          D Dm     A
Some have gone and some remain

          F#m               D
All these places have their moments 
     G                    A
With lovers and friends I still can recall
         F#m               B
Some are dead and some are living
   Dm           A
In my life I've loved them all


[Verse 2]

       A         E           F#m    A/G 
But of all these friends and lovers
         D  Dm     A
There is no one compares with you
          A        E          F#m    A/G 
And these memories lose their meaning
       D        Dm      A
When I think of love as something new

         F#m7                    D
Though I know I'll never lose affection
    G                      A
For people and things that went before
  F#m7                            B
I know I'll often stop and think about them
   Dm        A     
In my life I love you more

[Verse 3]

         F#m7                    D
Though I know I'll never lose affection
    G                      A
For people and things that went before
  F#m7                            B
I know I'll often stop and think about them
   Dm        A     
In my life I love you more
   Dm                     A 
In my life ... I love you more
