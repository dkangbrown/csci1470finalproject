Capo III


[Verse]

    D                   A           A7                   D
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better
  G                           D                    A       A7      D
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better

    D               A               A7                 D
Hey Jude, don’t be afraid, you were made to go out and get her 
    G                             D                A      A7      D
The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better


[Chorus]

D7                       G         Bm      Em                     A7              D
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, don’t carry the world upon your shoulders
D7                            G        Bm       Em                 A7             D
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool by making his world a little colder

[Verse]

    D                  A              A7                    D
Hey Jude, don’t let me down, you have found her, now go and get her
  G                          D                   A        A7      D
Remember to let her into you heart, then you can start to make it better


[Chorus]

D7                       G       Bm      Em                      A7            D
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin, you're waiting for someone to perform with
D7                                G        Bm           Em                   A7              D
And don’t you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do, the movement you need is on your shoulders

  G                            D                A      A7      D
Remember to let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better
