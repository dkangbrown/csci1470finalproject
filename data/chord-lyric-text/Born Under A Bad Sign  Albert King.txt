[Root] D

D
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
A
If it wasn't for bad luck
G
I wouldn't have no luck at all


[Verse]

D
Bad luck and trouble's my only friend
I've been down ever since I was ten


[Chorus] (x2)

D
I can't read, never learned how to write
My whole life is one big fight


[Solo]

D
Wine and women is all I crave
A big legged woman's gonna carry me to my grave


[Chorus]

D
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
A
If it wasn't for bad luck
G
I wouldn't have no luck
A
If it wasn't for real bad luck
G (stop)
I wouldn't have no luck at all
