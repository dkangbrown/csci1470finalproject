We all came out to Montreux
            F      G
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
        F              G
To make records with a mobile
          F         G
We didn't have much time

Frank Zappa and the Mothers
                 F      G
Were at the best place around
         F             G
But some stupid with a flare gun
                 F      G
Burned the place to the ground

C            G#         G
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
C            G#   E G A  E G B-A  E G A  G E  2x
Smoke on the water

     G               F        G
They burned down the gambling house
                F     G
It died with an awful sound
                           F      G
A funky Claude was running in and out
             F        G
Pulling kids outa the ground
        F       G
When it all was over
                F      G
We had to find another place
                   F       G
But Swiss time was running out
                        F        G
It seemed that we would lose the race

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
             F        G
It was empty cold and bare
                                        F       G
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
           F     G
Making our music there
       F       G         F       G
With a few red lights, a few old beds
          F        G
We made a place to sweat
                  F          G
No matter what we get out of this
                     F        G
I know, I know we'll never forget
