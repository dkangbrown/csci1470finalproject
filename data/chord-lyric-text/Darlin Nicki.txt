I knew a girl named Nikki, I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
  E                                B                  F#
I met her in a hotel lobby, Mastur*bating with a maga*zine
         G
She said how'd you like to waste some time,
      F#
and I couldn't resist when I saw little Nikki Grind


B                                    G
She took me to her castle And I just couldn't believe my eyes
E                            B                      F#
She had so many devices Everything that money could buy
G
She said sign your name on the dotted line
F#
The lights went out, and Nikki started to grind
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
NIKKI!

    B                          G
The castle started spinning or maybe it was my brain
E
I can't tell you what she did to me
       B                      F#
but my body will never be the same
G
Her lovin' will kick your behind
F#
Just to show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff, sho'nuff show you how to grind



     B                   G
Woke up the next morning Nikki wasn't there
E                                       B                   F#
I looked all over and all I found was a phone number on the stairs
        G
It said thank you for a funky time
F#
Call me up whenever you want to grind
COme Back Nikki Come Back!!!!!
