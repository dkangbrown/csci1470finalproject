INTRO:
G  D/F#  Em7  G/D  A/E  Bb/F


VERSE 1:
C/G              Am
I may not always love you,
Em      Em7           A7/G
But long as there are stars above you,
D/F#         Bbdim7
You�ll never need to doubt it,
D/A              Bm/F#
I'll make you so sure about it.


REFRAIN 1:
G        D/F#           Em7        D
God only knows what I'd be without you. 


VERSE 2:
C/G                Am
If you should ever leave me,
Em      Em7             A7/G
Though life would still go on believe me,
D/Gb                 Bbdim7     
The world could show nothing to me,
D/A              Bm/F#
So what good would living do me.


REFRAIN 2:
G        D/F#              Em7     D
God only knows what I'd be without you.
