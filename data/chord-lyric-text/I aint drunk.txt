Everyday baby, when the sun go down
I get with my friends, an' I begin to clown

Come home last night, all lush
Baby get in a fuss, I said, honey hush

You done the right thing, I wanna thank you, too
Now, let's have a little drink, just me and u

I wanna tip you, baby, before I go
I'll be back tomorrow night an' drink some more
I don't care, what the people are thinkin'
I ain't drunk, I'm just drinkin'

(But you're so high)
Oh no, you the one drunk, look at yo' eyes, man
(But you're so high)
Don't you tell my old lady, now

Well I ain't had it
(But you're so high)
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
(Stay drunk all the time)
