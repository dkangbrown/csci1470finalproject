[Verse]

A
Mama Pajama rolled out of bed
                          D
and she ran to the police station
         E
When the papa found out he began to shout
                                   A     D A
and that's what started the investigation

                      E                      A
But it's against the law, it was against the law
              E                    A
What the mama saw, was against the law

A
Well the mama looks down and she spit on the ground
                              D
Every time my name gets mentioned
         E
And the papa says "Oy, when I get that boy
                                    A        D A
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention!"


[Chorus]

              D                 A
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
          D               A          B          E
I'm on my way, takin' my time but I don't know where
            D              A
Goodbye to Rosie, Queen of Corona
         A       G     D           E     A

See you, me, and Julio down by the schoolyard
         A       G     D           E     A
See you, me, and Julio down by the schoolyard

[Verse]

A
In a couple of days they come and take me away
                            D
But the press let the story leak
              E
And when the radical priest come and get me released
                         A        D A
We's all on the cover of Newsweek.


[Chorus]

              D                 A
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
          D               A          B          E
I'm on my way, takin' my time but I don't know where
            D              A
Goodbye to Rosie, Queen of Corona
         A       G     D           E     A  
 A  E
See you, me, and Julio down by the schoolyard
         A       G     D           E     A
See you, me, and Julio down by the schoolyard
