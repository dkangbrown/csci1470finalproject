[Root] G

           G                         
Well I'm a runnin' down the road try'n to loosen my load
                     D     C
I've got seven women on my mind
G                       D
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
C                              G
One says she's a friend of mine


[Chorus]

         Em            C G
Take it easy, take it easy
              Am                C                 Em
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
          C                G
Lighten up while you still can
           C                G
Don't even try to understand
            Am                 C                     G
Just find a place to make your stand,  and take it easy


[Verse]

            G
Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
            D        C
Such a fine sight to see
       G                 D
It's a girl my lord in a flat-bed Ford
        C                        G
Slowin' down to take a look at me
          Em              C G
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
        Am                 C                 Em
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
       C               G                  C             G
We may lose and we may win, though we may never be here again
        Am              C                G
So open up I'm climbin' in, so take it easy


[Solo]

            G
Well, I'm a runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load
                       D     C
Got a world of trouble on my mind
G                       D                          C              G
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find


[Chorus]

         Em             C G
Take it easy,  take it easy
              Am                C                 Em
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
        C G             C  G
Come on baby, don't say maybe
        Am                 C                  G        
I gotta know of your sweet love is gonna save me

C       G       C       G       C       G       
ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh

          Em D C                     Em D C      Em
