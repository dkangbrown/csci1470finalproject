[Verse]

D          Bm               G       D
People get ready, there's a train a coming;
                  Bm                G      D
you don't need no baggage, you just get on board 
                Bm                G       D
All you need is faith to hear the diesels humming;
              Bm               G         D
don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

[Verse]

D          Bm            G        D
People get ready for the train to Jordan;
                Bm              G        D
it's picking up passengers from coast to coast 
             Bm            G         D
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em;
                      Bm         G         D
there's hope for all among those loved the most.

[Verse]

D              Bm           G        D
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner;
               Bm                  G        D
who would hurt all mankind just to save his own 
             Bm          G            D
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner;
               Bm                       G         D
for there's no hiding place against the Kingdom's throne

So, people get ready, there's a train a coming;
                  Bm                G      D
you don't need no baggage, you just get on board 
                Bm                G       D
All you need is faith to hear the diesels humming;
              Bm               G         D
don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

                  Bm               G         D
You don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord
