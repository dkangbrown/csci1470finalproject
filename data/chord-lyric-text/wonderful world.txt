I see trees of green, red roses too
Dm7          C    E7         Am
I see them bloom, for me and you,
      G#              Dm7/F    G7        C       Caug  Fmaj7   G7 
And I think to myself, What a  wonderful world.

      C        Em       F        Em
I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
Dm7                C        E7          Am
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
      G#              Dm7/F   G7        C      F   C
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky

Are also on the faces of people goin' by
       Am              G             Am          G
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
Am             Gdim7    Dm7  C#dim7  G7
They're really saying,  "I   love    you."

I hear Babies cry, I watch them grow
Dm7                C         E7        Am
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
      G#              Dm7/F  G7        C     Dm7b5
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

       Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
