[Verse]
C           Cmaj7       
I've seen love go by my door
F
It's never been this close before
C          Cmaj7         G7
Never been so easy or so slow
C               Cmaj7
Been shootin' in the dark too long
F
If something's not right it's wrong
C                    G                 C
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

C           Cmaj7
Dragon clouds so high above
F
I've only known careless love
C           Cmaj7         G7
It always has hit me from below
C             Cmaj7
But this time it's more correct
F
Right on target so direct
C                    G                 C
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

C            Cmaj7
Purple clover Queen Anne lace
F
Crimson hair across your face
C            Cmaj7               G7
You can make me cry if you don't know
C              Cmaj7
Can't remember what I was thinking of
F
You might be spoiling me too much love
C                    G                 C
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go


[Chorus]
G                                C
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
G                                  C
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
D7
Blue river running slow and lazy
F                                  G
I could spend forever with you and never realise the time

C           Cmaj7
Situations have ended sad
F
Relationships have all been bad
C            Cmaj7                 G7
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
C                  Cmaj7
But thereï¿½s no way I can compare
F
All those scenes to this affair
C                    G                 C
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go


[Chorus]
G                                    C
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
G                          C
Staying far behind without you
D7
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
F                                G
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to

C           Cmaj7
I'll look for you in old Honolula
F
San Francisco, Ashtabula
C            Cmaj7                 G7
You're gonna have to leave me now I know
C           Cmaj7
But I'll see you in the sky above
F
In the tall grass in the ones I love
C                    G                 C
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
