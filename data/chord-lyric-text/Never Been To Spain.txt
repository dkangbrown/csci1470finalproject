Well I never been to Spain
                     E
But I kinda like the music
                     A
Say the ladies are insane there
                          E
And they sure know how to use it
            B7
They don't abuse it
            A
Never gonna lose it
          E
I can't refuse it

Well I never been to England
                     E
But I kinda like the Beatles
                       A
Well, I headed for Las Vegas
                    E
Only made it out to Needles
        B7
Can you feel it
           A

         E
Feels so good

                        A
Well they tell me I was born there
                     E
But I really don't remember
       B7           A
In Oklahoma, not Arizona
