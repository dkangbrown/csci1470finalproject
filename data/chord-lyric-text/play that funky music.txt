[Verse 1]

Em7
Hey once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock and roll band
Em7
I never had no problems burning down them one night stands
Em7
And everything around me got to stop to feelin' so low 
Em7
And I decided quickly yes I did to disco down and check out the show


[Chorus]

             D   Em      D   E          D    E      D     E
Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
     D    Em      D   Em D  Em
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

Gm7
Play that funky music white boy play that funky music right
                          Bbm
Play that funky music white boy

Em             Bm             A7                    B7                  
Lay down a boogie and play that funky music till you die


[Verse 2]

Em7
I tried to understand this I thought that they were out of their minds
Em7
How could I be so foolish how could I to not see I was the one behind
Em7
So still I kept on fighting well loosing every step of the way
Em7
I said I must go back there I got to go back and check to see if things still the same


[Chorus]

             D   Em      D   E          D    E      D     E
Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
     D    Em      D   Em D  Em
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Gm7
Play that funky music white boy play that funky music right
                                   Bbm
Play that funky music white boy
Em7             Bm             A7                    B7                  
Lay down a boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die


[Verse 3]

Em7
Now first it wasn't easy changin' rock and roll and minds 
Em7
And things were getting shaky I thought I'd have to leave it behind
Em7
But now its so much better it's so much better I'm funking out in every way
Em7
But I'll never lose that feelin' no I won't of how I learned my lesson that day


[Chorus]

             D   Em      D   E          D    E      D     E
Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
     D    Em      D   Em D  Em
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Gm7
Play that funky music white boy play that funky music right
                                   Bbm
Play that funky music white boy
Em             Bm             A7                    B7                         
Lay down a boogie and play that funky music till you die
