[Root] E

Verse 1
E                               A
I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
E                   A
I was under the waves
E                    A
Before love rescued me
E                                       A
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
E (Mute)
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

Chorus 
A
Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
E                       E
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
E                  E
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
(Mute)
But I did what I did before love came to town

Verse 2

I used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

Verse 3

I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

[Chorus]

Verse 4
I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

[Chorus]
