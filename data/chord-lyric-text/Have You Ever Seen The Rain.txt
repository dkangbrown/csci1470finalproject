Someone told me long ago
                                     G
There's a calm before the storm, I know
                               C 
And it's been coming for some time

When it's over, so they say
                            G
It'll rain a sunny day, I know
                     C  C
Shining down like water
F                G
I wanna know
          C    C/B      Am   Am/G
Have you ever seen the rain
F          G  
I wanna know
          C    Em       Am
Have you ever seen the rain

Coming down on a sunny day

                                 G
Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
                    C
Been that way for all my time
C
'Til forever on it goes
                                  G
Thru the circle fast and slow, I know
                       C   C
And it can't stop, I wonder

F                G
I wanna know
       C    C/B      Am   Am/G
Have you ever seen the rain
F          G  
I wanna know
          C    Em       Am
Have you ever seen the rain
