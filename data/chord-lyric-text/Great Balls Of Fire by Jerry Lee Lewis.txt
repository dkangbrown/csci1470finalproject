[Root] C

[Verse 1]

C
   You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
F7
   Too much love drives a man insane
G7                   F7
   You broke my will,  but what a thrill
C
Goodness gracious great balls of fire


[Verse 2]

C
I laughed at love cause I thought it was funny
F7
You came along and you moved me honey
G7                 F7
I changed my mind, love's just fine
C
Goodness gracious great balls of fire


[Chorus]

F7                 C
Kiss me baby Woooooo it feels good
F7
Hold me baby
G7
Girl let me love you like a lover should
G7
  You're fine, 
G7  
  so kind. 
G7                                    G7 
I'm gone tell the world that you're mine mine mine mine.


[Verse 3]

C
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumb
F7
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
G7             F7
Come one baby, you're driving my crazy
C
Goodness gracious great balls of fire


[Chorus]

F7                 C
Kiss me baby Woooooo it feels good
F7
Hold me baby
G7
Girl let me love you like a lover should
G7
  You're fine, 
G7  
  so kind. 
G7                                    G7 
I'm gone tell the world that you're mine mine mine mine.

Come one baby, you're driving my crazy
