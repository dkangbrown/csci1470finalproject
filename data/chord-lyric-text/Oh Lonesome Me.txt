[Root] E

E                         B7
Everybody�s goin� out and havin fun.
                                     E
I�m just a fool for stayin� home and havin� none.
                 E7             A
I can�t get over how she set me free.
B7            E
Oh...lonesome me.

[Verse 2]
E                                B7
A bad mistake I�m makin� by just hanging �round.
                                       E
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town.
                       E7                   A
A lovesick fool that�s blind and just can�t see.
B7           E
Oh, lonesome me.

[Bridge]
     B                                 F#7
I�ll bet she�s not like me,......she�s out and fancy free,
                                    B
flirting with the boys with all her charms.
                               F#7                    
But I still love her so...and, brother don�t you know
                                      B      
I�d welcome her right back here in my arms.

[Verse 3]
B7          E                                 B7
Well, there must be someway I can lose these lonesome blues.
                                     E
Forget about the past and find some..body new.
                       E7              A
I�ve thought of every..thing from A to Z.
B7           E
Oh, lonesome me....
