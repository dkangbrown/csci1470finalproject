Mama's got a squeeze box

She wears on her chest

And when Daddy comes home

He never gets no rest

             D                (D**)
'Cause she's playing all night
        C
And the music's all right

Well the kids don't eat

And the dog can't sleep

There's no escape from the music

In the whole damn street
