You say you were wrong, to ever leave me alone
Now you're sorry, you're lonesome and scared
And you say you'd be happy, if you could just come back home
Well here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Call someone who'll listen and might give a damn
Maybe one of your sorted affairs
But don't you come 'round here handin' me none of your lines
Here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Well I thought what we had, could never turn bad
So your leavin' caught me unaware
But the fact is you've run, girl that can't be undone
So here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Call someone who'll listen and might give a damn
Maybe one of your sorted affairs
But don't you come 'round here handin' me none of your lines
Here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Yeah here's a quarter, call someone who cares
