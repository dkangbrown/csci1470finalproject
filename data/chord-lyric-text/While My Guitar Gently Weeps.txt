[Root] Am

[Verse]

  Am           Am/G       F#m7b5            Fmaj7
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Am          G          D        E
While my guitar gently weeps
  Am           Am/G       F#m7b5          Fmaj7
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Am          G          C        E
Still my guitar gently weeps
 

[Chorus]

A            C#m  F#m   C#m      Bm                  E
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
A            C#m F#m           C#m
I don't know how   someone controlled you
Bm                   E
They bought and sold you
 

[Verse]

  Am           Am/G       F#m7b5      Fmaj7
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
Am          G          D        E
While my guitar gently weeps
  Am             Am/G      F#m7b5    Fmaj7
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Am          G          C        E
Still my guitar gently weeps
 

[Chorus]

A            C#m  F#m       C#m
I don't know how you were diverted
Bm                 E
You were perverted too
A            C#m   F#m      C#m
I don't know how you were inverted
Bm             E
No one alerted you
 

[Verse]

  Am           Am/G       F#m7b5            Fmaj7
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Am          G          D        E
While my guitar gently weeps
  Am           Am/G       F#m7b5            Fmaj7
Look at you all...
Am          G          C        E
Still my guitar gently weeps
