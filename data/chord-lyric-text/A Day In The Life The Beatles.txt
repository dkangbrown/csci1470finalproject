[Root] G


[Verse 1]

G          Bm            Em    Em7
I read the news today oh boy

C        C/B          Asus2
About a lucky man who made the grade
G              Bm              Em   Em7
And though the news was rather sad
C           F       Em    Em7
Well I just had to laugh
C         F       Em   C
I saw the photograph


[Verse 2]

G           Bm            Em   Em7
He blew his mind out in a car
C         C/B              Asus2
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
G          Bm               Em      Em7
A crowd of people stood and stared
C               F
They'd seen his face before
Em
Nobody was really sure
   Em7                      C
If he was from the House of Lords


[Verse 3]

G       Bm            Em   Em7
I saw a film today oh boy
C           C/B           Asus2
The English Army had just won the war
G          Bm            Em   Em7
A crowd of people turned away
C          F          Em
But I just had to look
       Em7      C
Having read the book
            N.C
I'd love to turn you on

E
Woke up, fell out of bed
                         Dsus2
Dragged a comb across my head
         E                  B7sus4
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
    E            B7sus4             (B7)
And looking up I noticed I was late (ha ha ha.)
         E
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
                        Dsus2
Made the bus in seconds flat
         E                B7sus4
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
    E                         B7sus4
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream.


[Verse 4]

G          Bm            Em  Em7
I read the news today oh boy
C             C/B                 Asus2
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
G              Bm                Em    Em7
And though the holes were rather small
C           F
They had to count them all
Em                              Em7                      C
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
             N.C
I'd love to turn you on.
