[Root] G

 G
Two of us riding nowhere
                  Cadd9    Bm   Am7
Spending someone's hard  earned pay.
 G
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving 
Cadd9  Bm  Am7       G    G/D  Cadd9  D
On     our way back home
            Cadd9    G    G/D  Cadd9  D
We're on our way    home
            Cadd9    G    G/D  Cadd9
We're on our way    home
      Cadd9   G
We're going  home.


 G
Two of us sending postcards
               Cadd9  Bm Am7
Writing letters on    my wall
G
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
Cadd9  Bm  Am7       G   G/D  Cadd9  D
On     our way back home
             Cadd9   G   G/D  Cadd9  D
We're on our way    home
            Cadd9    G   G/D  Cadd9
We're on our way    home
      Cadd9 G
We're going home.


[Pre-Chorus]

Bb               Dm
You and I have memories
  Gm             Am                 Am7       D  
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead


[Chorus]

G
Two of us wearing raincoats
             Cadd9  Bm  Am7
Standing solo in    the sun.
 G
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
Cadd9  Bm  Am7       G   G/D  Cadd9  D 
On     our way back home
            Cadd9   G   G/D  Cadd9  D
We're on our way   home
            Cadd9   G   G/D  Cadd9
We're on our way   home
      Cadd9   G 
We're going  home.


[Pre-Chorus]

Bb             Dm
You and I have memories
Gm               Am                  Am7      D  
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead


[Chorus]

 G          
Two of us wearing raincoats
             Cadd9  Bm  Am7
Standing solo in    the sun.
G
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
Cadd9  Bm  Am7       G   G/D  Cadd9  D
On     our way back home
D            Cadd9   G   G/D  Cadd9  D
We're on our way    home
D            Cadd9   G   G/D  Cadd9  
We're on our way    home
      Cadd   G
We're going home.
