[Root] A

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true
          D7                     A
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true
       E7                     D7                 A       
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

[Verse 1]
As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coupe de Ville
Cadillac rollin' on the open road
Nothin' outruns my V-8 Ford
Cadillac doin' 'bout 95
Bumper-to-bumper, rollin' side by side

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true
          D7                     A
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true
       E7                     D7                 A       
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

[Verse 2]
Cadillac rolled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot, wouldn't do no more
It soon got cloudy and it started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passing lane
Rain was pourin' under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true
          D7                     A
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true
       E7                     D7                 A       
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

(instrumental, same pattern as chorus)

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true
          D7                     A
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true
       E7                     D7                 A       
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

[Verse 3]
Motor cooled down, the heat went down
That's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac sittin' like a ton of lead
110 half a mile ahead
The Cadillac looked like it was sittin' still
I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true
          D7                     A
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true
       E7                     D7                 A       
You've started back doin' the things you used to do
