[Root] C

C                Dm7
They asked how I knew,

G7               C     C+  F
my true love was true, oh, oh.

Cdim        Cmaj7
I of course replied:

Am7               Dm7   G7          C
"Something here inside, cannot be denied".


[Break] 

C   Bbdim   Dm7   G+


[Verse 2]

C                          Dm7
They said, some day you�ll find

G7                 C      C+  F
all whose love are blind, oh, oh.

Cdim                 Cmaj7
When your heart�s on fire,

Am7         Dm7   G7                 C
You must realize, smoke gets in your eyes.


[Bridge] 

C   F   C   D#7


[Chorus]

Ab                    
So I chaffed them and gaily laughed,

Abmaj7              Bbm7 Am7 Bb7 D#7 
to think they could doubt my love.

Ab                     G7     
Yet today, my love has flown away,

     C      Cmaj7 G7 G+
I am without my love.


[Verse 3]

C                      Dm7
Now laughing friends deride,

G7             C     C+  F
Tears I cannot hide, oh, oh.

Cdim           Cmaj7
So I smile and say:

Am7                  Dm7
�When a lovely flame dies,

G7                 C
Smoke gets in your eyes.


[Finale]

         F
�in your eyes

C                  Fmaj C+
Smoke gets in your eyes

Dm7        Em/G    Cmaj7
Smoke gets in your eyes
