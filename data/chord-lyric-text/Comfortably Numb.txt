Bm
Hello
                 A
Is there anybody in there ?
                    G         Em
Just nod if you can hear me
         Bm
Is there anyone at home ?
Bm
Come on now
            A
I hear your feeling down
G               Em
I can ease your pain
            Bm
And get you on your feet again
Bm
Relax
                    A
I'll need some information first
G              Em
Just the basic facts
        Bm
Can you show me where it hurts?



D                          A
There is no pain you are receding
D                             A
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves
C                                           G
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                     A
When I was a child I had a fever
   D                        A
My hands felt just like two ballons
C                               G
Now I've got that feeling once again
                               C
I can't explain, you would not understand
                  G
This is not how I am

A   Bm  C 9         G                D
I            have become comfortably numb.

I      have become comfortably numb.



Bm
O.K.
              G
Just a little pinprick
                        Em
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
            Bm
But you may feel a little sick
Bm      Bm9       Bm
Can you stand up?
                  A
I do believe it's working, good
                 G
That'll keep you going through the show
     Bm
Come on it's time to go.


D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding
D                             A
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves
     C                                      G
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                         A
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
D                       A
Out of the corner of my eye
C                           G
I turned to look but it was gone
                       C
I cannot put my finger on it now

The child is grown
    G
The dream is gone
Asus   A  G  C     G                D
And  I         have become comfortably numb.
