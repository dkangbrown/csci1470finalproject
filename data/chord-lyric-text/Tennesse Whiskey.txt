Verse 1

C                  F             C
I used to spend my nights in a bar room
C                            G
Liquor was the only friend I knew
          C              F               C
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottle
                             G             C
and you brought me back from being too far gone

Chorus:
C                F                  C
You're as smoo   ooth as Tennessee whiskey
                              G
You're as sweet as straw berry wine
         C          C7       F
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
          C               G            C
and I stay stoned on your love all the time

Verse 2:
C                     F            C
I looked for love in all the wrong places
                                         G
found the bottom of the bottle was always dry
         C                         F         C
but when you poured out your love  I didn't waste it
                                G               C
cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
