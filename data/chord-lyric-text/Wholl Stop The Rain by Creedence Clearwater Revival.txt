[Verse 1]

G                  C                    G
Long as I remember the rain been comin' down
G                         C                G
Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground
  
C                    G
Good men through the ages 
C                  G
Tryin' to find the sun
C            D
And I wonder still I wonder
Em                      G
Who'll stop the rain


[Verse 2]

G                            C                G
I went down Virginia seeking shelter from the storm
G                Bm      C                 G
Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow  

C                   G
Five-year plans and new deals
C                 G
Wrapped in golden chains
C             D
And I wonder, still I wonder
Em                      G
Who'll stop the rain

[Verse 3]

G                          C                  G
Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more
    G                  Bm           C             G
The crowd had rushed together, just tryin to keep warm

C                   G
Still the rain kept pourin'
C            G
Fallin on my ears
C             D
And I wonder, still I wonder
Em
Who'll stop the rain...
