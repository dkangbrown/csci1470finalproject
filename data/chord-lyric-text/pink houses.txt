There's a black man, with a black cat, living in a black neighborhood.

He's got an interstate running through his  front yard;
            F           C         G
you know he thinks he's got it so good
              G
And there's a woman, in the kitchen, cleaning up the evening slop.
       F
And he looks at her and says, "Hey darlin'
C                             G
I can remember when you could stop a clock"

Oh, but ain;t that America, for you and me?
           C                     G
Ain't that America, something to see baby?
           C                    D
Ain't that America, home of the free?
                        C
Little pink houses, for you and me

Well there's a young man, in a tee-shirt,

listening to a rockin' rollin' station

He's got greasy hair, and a greasy smile he says,
 F              C          G
"Lord this must be my destination"

Cause they told me, when I was younger,

"Boy you're gonna be President"
              F                               C
But just like everything else those old crazy dreams,
                    G
just kinda came and went

Well there's people, and more people; what do they know?
                                  F                     C           G
Go to work in some high rise, and vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico
            G
And there's winners, and there's losers;

but they ain't no big deal
            F                            C
Because the simple man baby pays for the thrills, the bills,
    G
the pills that kill
