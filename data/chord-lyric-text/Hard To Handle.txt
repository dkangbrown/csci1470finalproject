B
Baby here I am
B
I'm the man on the scene
B
I can give you what you want
B
But you gotta' come home with me
B
I have got some good old lovin'
B
And I got some more in store
B
When I get through throwin' it on you
B
You gotta' come back for more 


[Chorus 1]

F#
Boys and things that come by the dozen
F#
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'

Hey little thing let me light your candle

'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now,

Gets around

B
Action speaks louder than words
B
And I'm a man of great experience
B
I know you've got another man
B
But I can love you better than him
B
Take my hand don't be afraid
B
I'm gonna prove every word I say
B
I'm advertising love for free
B
So you can place your ad with me


[Chorus 2]

F#
Boys that come along are a dime by the dozen
F#
That ain't nothin' but ten cent love

Hey little thing let me light your candle

'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now,
