I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log
I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me across your log
I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot dog!'

I've got a double-bladed axe
That really cuts good
I'm a cross cut saw
Just burry me in the wood

I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log
I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot dog!'

Some call me wood-choppin' Sam
Some call me wood-cuttin' Ben
Last girl I cut the wood for
Want me back again

I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log
I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot dog!'
