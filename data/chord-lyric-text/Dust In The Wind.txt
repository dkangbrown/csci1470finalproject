[Root] Am

  C     G  Am    G         Dm            Am
I close my eyes only for a moment and a moment�s gone.
C   G   Am     G             Dm          Am
All my dreams pass before my eyes are curiosity.

D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.

C     G   Am    G             Dm              Am
Same old song, just a drop of water in the endless sea.
C   G  Am   G                 Dm                Am
All we do, crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see.

D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.

C     G    Am   G                Dm             Am
Don't hang on, nothing last�s forever but the earth and sky.
C  G      Am  G                  Dm         Am
It slips away all your money won�t another minute buy.

D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind
D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Dust in the wind, everything is dust in the wind.
