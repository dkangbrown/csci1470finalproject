[Root] D

D         Em
You got a lotta nerve
   G              D
To say you are my friend
           A
When I was down
G        Bm          A      
You just stood there grinning


D         Em
You got a lotta nerve
   G                             D
To say you got a helping hand to lend
                    G
You just want to be on
    Bm          A      
The side that's winning


D         Em
You say I let you down
    G                  D
You know it's not like that
             A
If you're so hurt
G        Bm        A      
Why then don't you show it


D           Em
You say you lost your faith
    G                     D
But that's not where it's at
            G        Bm
You have no faith to lose
        A      
And you know it


D          Em
I know the reason
         G              D
That you talk behind my back
  A           G        Bm
I used to be among the crowd
       A      
You're in with


D                  Em
Do you take me for such a fool
   G                 D
To think I'd make contact
                 G        Bm
With the one who tries to hide
                        A      
What he don't know to begin with


D          Em
You see me on the street
    G             D
You always act surprised
          A                   G
You say, "How are you?" "Good luck"
    Bm        A      
But you don't mean it
 

D                Em
When you know as well as me
             G          D
You'd rather see me paralyzed
                   G        Bm
Why don't you just come out once
    A      
And scream it


D            Em
No, I do not feel that good
               G                 D
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
                  A
If I was a master thief
   Bm       A      
Perhaps I'd rob them


D                        Em
And now I know you're dissatisfied
          G                 D
With your position and your place
               G
Don't you understand
     Bm     A      
It's not my problem


D               Em
I wish that for just one time
G                         D
You could stand inside my shoes
                      A
And just for that one moment
Bm      A      
I could be you


D                    Em
Yes, I wish that for just one time
G                         D
You could stand inside my shoes
                  G       Bm
You'd know what a drag it is
   A      
To see you
