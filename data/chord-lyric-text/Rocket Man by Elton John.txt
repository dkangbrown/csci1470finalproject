[Root] G


[Verse 1]

Em7                              A     Asus4 
She packed my bags last night - pre-flight   
Em7              A  Asus4
Zero hour, nine A.M. 
C                G          Am   D Dsus4 Dsus2 
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then    
Em7                        A         Asus4 
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife  
Em7                 A Asus4 
It's lonely out in space  
C            G       Am     D   Dsus4 Dsus2 
On such a timeless flight as this    


[Chorus]

  G                                    C 
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
                                   G      
Til touchdown brings me 'round to find  
                                    C 
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
           G          A     Asus4 
Oh no, no,no, I'm a rocket man  
  C                                  G          C 
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone         (2x)


[Verse 2]

Em7                              A       Asus4 
Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids  
Em7                    A  Asus4 
In fact it's cold as hell  
C                   G           Am             D Dsus4 Dsus2 
And there's no one there to raise them if you did    

Em7                               A      Asus4 
And all this science, I don't understand  
Em7                           A   Asus4 
It's just my job five days a week  
C      G    Am     D Dsus4 Dsus2 
Rocket man    rocket man    

 
[Chorus]

  G                                    C 
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
                                    G 
Til touchdown brings me 'round to find  
                                     C 
I'm not the man they think I am at home  
             G           A     Asus4 
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man  
  C                              G          C 
Rocket man, burnin' out his up here alone        (2x) 
 

[Outro]

  C                              G 
And I think it's gonna be a long long time  
  C                              G 
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
