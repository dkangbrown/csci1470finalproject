  G
Livin' my life in a slow hell 
  C
Different girl every night at the hotel 
  D                         C      G
I aint seen the sun shine in 3 damn days 
  G
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whisky 
  C
Wish I had a good girl to miss me 
  D                       C           G
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways 
            E
I put your picture away 
              G
Sat down and cried the day 
        D                 C            G
I can't look at you, I'm lyin' next to her 
            E                           G
I put your picture away, sat down and cried today 
        D                C            G
I can't look at you I'm lyin' next to her

  G
I called you lastnight in the hotel 
  C
Everyone knows but they wont tell 
         D
But their half hearted smiles tell me 
         C           G
Somethin' just ain't right 
       G
I been waitin' on you for a long time 
  C
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine 
  D                       C      G
I ain't heard from you in 3 damn nights 
           E
I put your picture away 
         G
I wonder where you been 
         D                     C            G
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him 
           E
