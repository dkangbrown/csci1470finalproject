G    D            Em 
If I leave here tomorrow
F         C              D
Would you still remember me?
G             D          Em
For I must be travelling on now
F                    C             D
Cos there's too many places I must see

G    D              Em
If I stay here with you girl
F           C               D
Things just couldn't be the same
G          D         Em
Cos I'm as free as a bird now
F        C               D
And this bird you cannot change
F        C               D
And this bird you cannot change
F        C               D
And this bird you cannot change
F    C             D
Lord knows I can't change

G        D           Em
Bye bye, it's been a sweet love
F           C               D
Though this feeling I can't change
G                D          Em
But please don't take it so badly
F                  C      D
Cos the Lord knows I'm to blame
 
G        D              Em
But if I stay here with you girl
F           C               D
Things just couldn't be the same
G          D         Em
Cos I'm as free as a bird now
F        C               D
And this bird you cannot change oh oh oh
F        C               D
And this bird you cannot change
F        C               D
And this bird you cannot change
F    C             D
Lord knows I can't change

F    C               D
Lord help me I can't change
G    Bb      C
Lord I can't change
G  Bb      C
Oh I can't change
G   Bb   C           G
Fly high freebird oh yeah! . . .
