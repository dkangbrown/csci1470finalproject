[Root] Dm


[Verse 1]

Dm                      C                          
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears, 
        Bb                              A
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair 
Dm                     C                   
I hear the sound of a gentle word 
       Bb                                      A   C
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

[Verse 2]

Dm                            C           
 Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Bb                                A
 Softly smile, I know she must be kind
Dm           C                     
 When I look in her eyes
         Bb                         A  C
She goes with me to a blossom world
