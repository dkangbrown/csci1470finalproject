[Root] D

       Bm                 G
   The long and winding road 
         D     D7        G
   that leads to your door
 G       F#m       Bm    Bm
   Will never disappear
 Em               A        D   D7
   I've seen that road before 
 G       F#m        Bm  
   It always leads me here
 Em         A       D  
   leads me to your door

       Bm                 G
   The wild and windy night 
         D     D7        G
   that the rain washed away
 G       F#m       Bm    Bm
   Has left a pool of tears 
 Em               A        D   D7
   crying for the day
 G       F#m        Bm  
   Why leave me standing here
 Em         A       D  
   let me know the way
   
   D                G                       
   Many times I've been alone and 
   F#m             Em
   Many times I've cried 
   D               G
   Anyway you'll never know the 
   F#m            Em
   Many ways I've tried but
 
   D                                  G     
   Still they lead me back to the long and winding road 
    F#m                          Em
   You left me standing here a long, long time ago 
   D                                  G 
   Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door 
    F#m                          Em
   Da, da, da, da--
