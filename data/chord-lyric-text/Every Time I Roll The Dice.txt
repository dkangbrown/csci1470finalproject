[Verse]
                               G                      C             
She's got a roof that don't leak, When the rain's pouring down 
                        D                         G
She's got a place I can sleep, Where I'm safe and sound
                        G                       C
She's got a lock on her door, But she gave me a key
                   D                               G
She don't walk the floor Oh, but she worries about me 

[Chorus]
                C        D
Her love has no strings, shackles or chains
    Em                      C     C7
But I'm holding on for dear life 
                     G      D                     G
She's like rolling a seven, Every time I roll the dice 

[Verse]
                G                                      C
She's got a big Oldsmobile, She's got a dog that won't bite 
                        D                               G
She's got a heart I can steal, Just like a thief in the night
                       G                         C
She got a slow burning fire, She keeps her radio low
              D                               G
When she gets inspired, We let the good times roll 


[Chorus]
                C        D
Her love has no strings, shackles or chains
    Em                      C     C7
But I'm holding on for dear life 
                     G      D                     G
She's like rolling a seven, Every time I roll the dice

Every time I roll, Every time I roll the dice
