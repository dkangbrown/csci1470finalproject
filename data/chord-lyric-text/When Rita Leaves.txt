She left a lipstick letter on the mirror shattered on the bathroom floor.
                                              E
All I could put back together was never see me no more.
                                            A                        F#m
Took all her clothes but one red dress, the one she knows I like the best.
            E                   B                           E  
All I could do was clean up the mess, and wonder where she'd gone.



        E                              B                        
I had a sky-blue rag top Mustang, a 1964.
                                                     E     
She drove it off into the night til it just wouldn't go no more.
                                            A                    F#m        
She caught a ride on into town, bought some gas and laid the top down.
         E                       B                           E
Then she burned that pony to the ground on the desert in New Mexico.



Chorus
          B              E
When Rita leaves, Rita's gone.
    B                                E
She gave me every chance a man could want.
           A      
I've never known a love so strong,
      E                          A
Or so crazy when she's been done wrong.
          B              E
When Rita leaves, Rita's gone.

I put a call into her mamasita, back in El Paso.
                                                   E
She said she got the story from Rita on her way to Mexico.
                                                 A              F#m
Her mama knew I was taking it hard, said she was sorry about my car.
                  E                            B                                 
She said "You're lucky all she broke was your heart
                E 
You better just let her go."


Chorus
          B              E
When Rita leaves, Rita's gone.
    B                                E
She gave me every chance a man could want.
           A      
I've never known a love so strong
      E                          A
Or so crazy when she's been done wrong.
          B              E
When Rita leaves, Rita's gone.


E
She never gave me a chance to explain.
       A                                F#m
Hell I guess it doesn't much matter now anyway.
          B              E
When Rita leaves, Rita's gone.
          B              E
When Rita leaves, Rita's gone.
