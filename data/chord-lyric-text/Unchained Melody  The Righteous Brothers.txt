Oh,  my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch
Am           G
A long, lonely time
    C     Am        F          G           C

[Chorus]

F             G           F           Eb
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
F           G           C
To the open arms of the sea
F             G              F            Eb
Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
F              G          C
I'll be coming home, wait for me

For love. Lonely time.
