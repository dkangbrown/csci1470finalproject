You never give me your money,
G                     C
You only give me your funny paper  
Fmaj7                Dm6    E
And in the middle of negotiations,
    Am     
You break down

Am7                 Dm7
I never give you my number,
G                  C
I only give you my situation,
Fmaj7                Dm6     E
And in the middle of investigations,
    Am
You break down

C               E7
Out of college, money spent
Am             C7
See no future, pay no rent
F               G                C  C7
All the money's gone, nowhere to go

C          E7
Any jobber got the sack,
Am              C7
Monday morning, turning back,
F            G                C  C7
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go.

    Bb            F
But oh that magic feeling: 
F          C
Nowhere to go
Bb             F
Oh, that magic feeling,
F          C              
Nowhere to go, Nowhere to go

  One sweet dream:
C    
Pick up the bags,
E7         A7
Get in the limousine

Dm7            G7
Soon We'll be away from here,
Dm7                 G7              A
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
          B7         Cmaj7  G
One sweet dream come true, 
    A         C G  A
Today, Came true today

C             G
