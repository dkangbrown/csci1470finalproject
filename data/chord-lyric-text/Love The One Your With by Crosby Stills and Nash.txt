Verse:

D             G    D   D          Em7    D
If you're down         and confused
D                   G  D         D               Em7   D
And you don't remember          who you're talking to
D         G  D    D        Em7   D
Concentration    slips away
D              G  D     D        Em7   D
Because your baby       is so far away


Chorus:
               Bm  A             G         
Well there's a rose in a fisted glove
        Bm      A         G      
And the eagle flies with the dove
            Bm      A                G 
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
                     D   G    D         
Love the one you're with
            D        Em7       D
You gotta love the one you're with
            D              G  D
You gotta love the one you're with
            D        Em7       D
You gotta love the one you're with
