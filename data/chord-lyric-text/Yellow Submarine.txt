           D              C         G
In the town where I was born
 Em       Am          C        D
Lived a man who sailed to sea
 G        D       C      G
And he told us of his life
 Em     Am       C      D
  In the land of submarines
 
 G        D         C      G
So we sailed up to the sun
 Em      Am       C       D
Till we found the sea of green
 G        D         C              G
And we lived beneath the waves
 Em     Am    C       D
In our yellow submarine
 

[Chorus]

  G                   D
We all live in a yellow submarine
   D                        G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                      D
We all live in a yellow submarine 
   D                        G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine


[Verse]
 
              D          C  G
And our friends are all on board
 Em   Am          C           D
Many more of them live next door
 G          D        C         G     
And the band begins to play

Em      Am       C       D

[Chorus]

  G                   D
We all live in a yellow submarine
   D                        G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                      D
We all live in a yellow submarine 
   D                        G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

 G      D     C       G
As we live a life of ease
 Em    Am               C        D
   Everyone of us has all we need
 G        D         C         G
Sky of blue and sea of green
 Em       Am     C     D
   In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
