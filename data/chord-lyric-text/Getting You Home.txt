[Root] A

[Verse]

         Am             D           G               C   G
  Tuxedo waiters, black tie, white tablecloths and red wine
                Am         D                G                  C   G
  We've been plannin', this night, lookin' forward to it for some time
           C                            G
  Honey I know you love gettin' dressed up 
           C                       G
  And you know I love showin' you off
                 Am             C                           C
  Watchin' your baby blue eyes dancin' in the candle light glow
                   Am    D                   G
  When all I can think about is getting you home


[Chorus]

                        Am                     G
  Walkin' through the front door seein' your black dress hit the floor
               Am                 C                  C
  Honey there sure ain't nothin' like you lovin' me all night long
                  Am     D                   G
  When all I can think about is gettin' you home


[Verse]

                     Am         D               G
  I don't need this menu, no I don't, I already know just what I want
                  Am                 D                   G         C     G
  Did I hear you right, did you tell me, to go pay the waiter and lets leave
            C                        G             C                     G
  Honey I know by that look in your eye and your hand drawin' hearts on mine
                 Am                C                    C
  That our night out of the house ain't gonna last too long
                    Am     D                  G
  When all you can think about is gettin' me home


[Chorus]

                       Am                     G
  Walkin' through the front door seein' your black dress hit the floor
               Am                 C                  C
  Honey there sure ain't nothin' like you lovin' me all night long
                  Am     D                   G
  When all I can think about is getting you home

                        Am                    G (strum once, let ring)
  Walkin' through the front door seein' your black dress hit the floor
               Am                  C                 C
  Honey there sure ain't nothin' like you lovin' me all night long
                  Am     D                Am    D
  When all I can think about, all I can think about...
             Am     D                   G
  All I can think about is gettin' you home
