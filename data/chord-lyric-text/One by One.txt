there is something
I've got get off my chest 
so baby plug you ears 
if you're insane

there is an illusion
meant to blow 
when it gets fucked up
you're not to blame

Change the system from the inside
explode it out to space
it's just confusion meant to divide us one by one

what I really meant to say
is baby it's bullshit
meant to enslave us one by one

ooooooo
life fantastic

sh

if you did
would you even care
times a come to
even if I dare
