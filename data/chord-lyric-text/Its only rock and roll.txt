E
     If I could stick my pen in my heart
     I would spill it all over the stage
     A         G    A               G        A
     Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya,
     E                   A   G  E
     Would you think the boy is strange?
              A  G  E
     Ain't he strange?
     
     E
     If I could win ya, If I could sing ya
     a love song so divine
     A        G   A               G       A
     would it be enough for your cheating heart
     E           A   G   E
     if I broke down and cried?
          A G E
     If I cried?
     
          CHORUS
                 A                                        E
          I said I know... it's only rock and roll, but I like it
          A
          I know... it's only rock and roll,
                E        D        A     E
          but I like it, like it, yes I do
                  A
          Oh well I like it 
            E
          I like it
            A
          I like it
                 D         A
          I said can't you see
               D        A              E
          that this old boy has been a-lonely
     
     E
     If I could stick a knife in my heart
     Suicide right on the stage
     A        G   A              G       A  
     Would it be enough for your teenage lust
     E                A    G   E
     Would it help to ease the pain?
               A G E
     Ease your brain?
     
     E
     If I could dig down deep in my heart
     Feelings would flood on the page
     A        G     A              G        A
     Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya,
     E                   A     G    E
     Would you think the boy's insane?
          A G E
     He's insane

B                                             D
And do ya think that you're the only girl around?
I bet you think that you're the only woman in town!

A                                           E
I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it
I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it  D        A    E
I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do
Oh, well, I like it, I like it. I like it...
