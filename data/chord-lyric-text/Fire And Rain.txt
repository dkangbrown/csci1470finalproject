[Intro]

A G D A  A E G  A

[Verse 1]

               Em                  D             A   Asus2 A
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone 
            E                      G
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you 
  A               Em            D               A   Asus2 A
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song 
               E             G          G D
I just can't remember who to send it to 

[Chorus]

D         Bm                 A   Asus2 A
I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
          D                 Bm                  A  Asus2 A
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
          D                   Bm               A      Asus2 A
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
      G                       Em       A   A7
But I always thought that I'd see you again 

[Verse 2]

          A                  Em
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
              D              A    Asus2 A
You've got to help me make a stand 
                   E               G
You've just got to see me through another day 
A         Em            D          A   Asus2 A
My body's aching and my time is at hand 
            E           G         G D
And I won't make it any other way 

[Chorus]

D             Bm                 A   Asus2 A
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
          D                 Bm                  A  Asus2 A
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
          D                   Bm               A      Asus2 A
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
      G                       Em       A   A7
But I always thought that I'd see you again 

[Verse 3]

     A                     Em            D                       A  Asus2 A
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun 
                    E                     G
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around 
              A                    Em                D                    A  Asus2 A
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come 
                 E                  G                    G D 
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground 

[Chorus]

D             Bm                 A   Asus2 A
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
          D                 Bm                  A  Asus2 A
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
          D                   Bm               A      Asus2 A
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
      G                       Em                            A   A7
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again 

[Outro]

            G                Em    A
Thought I'd see you one more time again 
               G                    Em             A
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now 
            G                    Em               A
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now . . .
