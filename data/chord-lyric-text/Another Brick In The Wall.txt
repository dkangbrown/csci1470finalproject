[Root] Dm


[Verse]

Dm 
We don't need no education
Dm
We don't need no thoughts controlled 
Dm
No dark sarcasm in the class room
Dm                              G        
Teacher leave those kids alone
G                                 Dm
Hey Teacher leave them kids alone


[Chorus]

F                    C                        Dm
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
F                      C                        Dm
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
