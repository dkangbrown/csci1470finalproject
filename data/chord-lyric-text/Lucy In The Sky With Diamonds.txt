[Intro]

A A/G A/F# A/F or F


[Verse 1]

A           A/G       A/F#(F)   A/F(F)
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
     A         A/G       A/F#      F
with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
A              A/G      A/F#         A/F
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
  A            A/G       A/F#      Dm    F
a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Bb                    C
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
F                  Bb
towering over your head.
C                          G
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
          D
and she's gone


[Chorus]

G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.


[Verse 2]

A          A/G       A/F#(F)     A/E(F)
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
      A             A/G        A/F#        F
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
A               A/G                   A/F(F)
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
     A       A/G        F
that grow so incredibly high.
Bb                C
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
F                   Bb
waiting to take you away.
C                           G
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
           D
and you're gone.


[Chorus]

G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
G           C        D         D   A
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
G           C        D
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
G           C        D         D   A
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.
