[Root] G

G                        C
  We're caught in a trap;  I can't walk out
D               C               G
  because I love you too much,  baby.
G                    C
  Why can't you see,   what you're doing to me,
D                      C          D     C  Bm  D7
  when you don't believe a word I say?


[Chorus]

  C                G        Bm                  C    D
     We can't go on together, with Suspicious Minds;
  Em                  Bm          C              D       D7
     and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds.


[Verse]

G                              C
  So, if an old friend I know, drops by to say hello,
D                 C           G
  would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
G                  C
  Here we go again, asking where I've been.
D                       C               D      C  Bm  D7
  You can see these tears are real I'm crying.


[Chorus]

  C                G        Bm                  C
     We can't go on together, with Suspicious Minds;
  Em                  Bm           C              B7sus4   B7
     and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds...

       Em             Bm            C
          Oh, let our love survive,
                       D
          I'll dry the tears from your eyes.
       Em                   Bm             C
          Let's don't let a good thing die,  when honey,
             D                G               C    G       D7
          you know I've never,  lied to you;   Mmm,  yeah,  yeah!


[Verse]

G                        C
  We're caught in a trap;  I can't walk out
D               C               G
  because I love you too much,  baby.
G                    C
  Why can't you see,   what you're doing to me,
D                      C          D     C  Bm  D7
  when you don't believe a word I say?
