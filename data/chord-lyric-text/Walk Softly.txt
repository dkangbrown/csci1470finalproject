[Verse]
A
You say your sorry once again dear
               E                  A
You want me to take you back once more
D                          A
You say you need a helping hand dear
    D               E            A
But that's what you told me once before

[Chorus]
A
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
A              E           A
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
D                        A
Let it rest in piece and quiet love
     D       E               A
Walk softly on this heart of mine
Walk on

A
I know some day you'll find a new love
A
I fell your heart has turned to stone
    D                       A
But please let me down real easy
      D                E              A
Cause loneliness moves in as you move on

[Chorus]
A
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
A              E           A
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
D                        A
Let it rest in piece and quiet love
D           E                A
Walk softly on this heart of mine
D           E                A
Walk softly on this heart of mine
D           E                    A
Walk softly on this heart of mine
