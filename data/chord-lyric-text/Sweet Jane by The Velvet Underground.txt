[Verse]
D            A     G Bm A D        A     G  Bm A
Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and me
I'm in a rock'n'roll band  Hah!
Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim
Y'know, those were different times!
Oh, all the poets they studied rules of verse
And the ladies, they rolled their eyes


[Chorus]
Sweet Jane!  Whoa!  Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a!  Sweet Jane!

I'll tell you something
Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
Both of them save their monies, ha
And when, when they come home from work
Sittin' down by the fire, oh!  
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers"
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah
Sweet Jane!  Come on baby! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a!  Sweet Jane!


[Verse]
Some people, they like to go out dancing 
And other peoples, they have to work, Just watch me now!  
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
Y'know that, women, never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!  
And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is just to die! 
And, everyone who ever had a heart
They wouldn't turn around and break it  
And anyone who ever played a part 
Oh wouldn't turn around and hate it!


[Chorus]
Sweet Jane!  Whoa-oh-oh!  Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane!
 D            G         D
Sweet Jane  Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane  Sweet Jane (repeat and fade)
