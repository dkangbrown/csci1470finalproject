[Root] G

G\n Mother, mother ocean,  
I have heard you call 
C\n Wanted to sail upon your waters 
since I was D\n three feet G\n tall 
You've seen it Am\n all, 
Bm\n you've seen Am\n it G\n all  C\n-G\n

G\n Watched the men who rode you,  
switch from sails to steam 
C\n And in your belly you hold the treasures 
D\n few have ever G\n seen 
Most of 'em Am\n dream, 
Bm\n most of Am\n 'Em G\n dream  C\n-G\n

G\n Yes I Am A pirate,  
two hundred years too late 
C\n The cannons don't thunder, 
there's nothin' to plunder 
I'm an over-forty D\n victim of G\n fate 
Arriving too Am\n late, 
Bm\n arriving Am\n too G\n late 

G\n I've done a bit of  smugglin',  
I've run my share of grass 
C\n I made enough money to buy Miami, 
but I pissed it D\n away so G\n fast 
Never Am\n meant to last, 
Bm\n never Am\n meant to G\n last C\n-G\n

G\n And I have been drunk now for over two weeks 
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks 
But I C \ngot stop wishin', got to go fishin' 
Down to D\n rock bottom G\n again 
Just a few Am\n friends, 
Bm\n just A Am\n few G\n friends

G\n I go for younger women, 
lived with several awhile 
C\n Though I ran 'em away, 
they'd come back one day 
Still could D\n manage to G\n smile 
Just Am\n takes a while, 
Bm\n  just Am takes A G\n while 

G\n Mother, mother ocean, 
after all the years I've found 
C My occupational hazard being 
my occupation's just D\n not G\n around 
I feel like I've Am\n drowned, 
Bm\n gonna Am\n head up G\n town

I feel like I've Am\n drowned, 
Bm\n gonna Am\n head up G\n town C\n-G\n
