[Verse]

E              G          A
Purple haze all in my brain

Lately things don't seem the same

Actin' funny, but I don't know why


[Bridge]

E                               RIFF
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky


[Verse]

E            G        A  
Purple haze all around

Don't know if I'm comin' up or down

Am I happy or in misery?


[Bridge]

E                                          RIFF
What ever it is, that girl put a spell on me


[Interlude]

A
Help me

B
Help me

E
Oh, no, no


[Guitar solo + Riff]


[Verse]

E                   A         B
Purple haze all in my eyes, uhh

Don't know if it's day or night

You got me blowin', blowin' my mind

E
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

Ooo


[Outro]

A
Help me

B
Ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze, yeah

E
Oh, no, oh

Oh, help me
