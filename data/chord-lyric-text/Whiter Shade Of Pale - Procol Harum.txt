C Em/B Am C/G F F/E Dm Dm/C G G/F Em G7/D C F G

Verse 1 (same for Verse 2, verse 2 lyrics at bottom)

C    Em/B              Am     C/G
We skipped the light fandango
F    F/E                     Dm    Dm/C
turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
G       G/F          Em      G7/D
I was feeling kinda seasick
C        Em/B           Am         C/G
but the crowd called out for more
F       F/E          Dm     Dm/C
The room was humming harder
G       G/F          Em    G7/D
as the ceiling flew away
C          Em/B            Am     C/G
When we called out for another drink
F       F/E          Dm
the waiter brought a tray

Chorus

G          C  Em/B        Am    C/G
And so it was,___ that later,____
F       F/E             Dm  Dm/C
as the miller told his tale
G   G/F                  Em           G7/D
that her face, at first just ghostly,
           C    F        C    G7
turned a whiter shade of pale

Verse 2

She said, 'There is no reason
and the truth is plain to see.'
But I wandered through my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
and although my eyes were open
they might have just as well've been closed
