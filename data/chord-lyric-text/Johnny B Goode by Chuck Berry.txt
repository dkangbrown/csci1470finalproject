A                            Asus4   A
Deep down Louisiana close to New   Orleans
                                   Asus4 A
Way back up in the woods among the ever  greens
      D
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
      A                         Asus4     A
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
    E                             E7*      E
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
             A                           Asus4     A
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell


[Chorus]

A
Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
D
Go
Go Johnny go
A
Go
Go Johnny go
E  E7
Go
          A
Johnny B. Goode

   A                             Asus4 A
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
                               Asus4    A
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
        D
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
A                                  Asus4   A
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
E                            E7       E
People passing by they would stop and say
   A                      Asus4     A
Oh my that little country boy could play


[Chorus]

A
Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
D
Go
Go Johnny go
A
Go
Go Johnny go
E  E7
Go
          A
Johnny B. Goode

    A                                 Asus4 A
His mother told him "Someday you will be a  man,
                                Asus4   A
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
D
Many people coming from miles around
   A                                 Asus4  A
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
E                            E7    E
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
       A         Asus4   A
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."


[Chorus]
A
Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
D
Go
Go Johnny go
A
Go
Go Johnny go
E  E7
Go
          A
Johnny B. Goode
