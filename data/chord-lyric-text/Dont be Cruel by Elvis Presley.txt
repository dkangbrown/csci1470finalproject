
    D
You know I can be found,

sitting home all alone,
   G
If you can't come around, 
   D
at least please telephone.
         Em    A                  D
Don't be cruel  to a heart that's true.

D
Baby, if I made you mad 

for something I might have said,
G
Please, let's forget the past, 
    D
the future looks bright ahead,
         Em    A                  D
Don't be cruel  to a heart that's true.

        G             A
I don't want no other love,
G              A                D
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.

D
Don't stop thinking of me, 

don't make me feel this way,
     G              
Come on over here and love me, 
    D
you know what I want you to say.
         Em    A                  D
Don't be cruel  to a heart that's true.
    G             A
Why should we be apart?
  G               A              D
I really love you baby, cross my heart.

      D 
Let's walk up to the preacher 

and let us say I do,
G
Then you'll know you'll have me, 
         D
and I'll know that I'll have you,
         Em    A                  D
Don't be cruel  to a heart that's true.

Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.
