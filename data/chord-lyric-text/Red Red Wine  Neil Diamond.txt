D       G   C D
Red red wine,
         G   C D
Go to my head
           G        C  D
Make me forget that I
               G  C D
Still need her so

        G   C D
Red red wine,
           G  C D 
It's up to you
          G       C    D
All I can do I've done,
                   G C D
But memories won't go;
    D              G C D   
No, memories won't go

       D
I have sworn,
          G
That with time,
            C                  G
Thoughts of you would leave my head
      D            G
I was wrong, and I find,
         C                 D
Just one thing makes me forget

        G   C D  
Red red wine,
              G C D
Stay close to me
             G   C    D
Don't let me be alone,
              G   C D
It's tearing apart;
   D          G    C D
My blue, blue heart.
