 Super freak, super freak

(The chord pattern is just repeated throughout)

 She's a very special girl
 (The kind of girl you want to know)
 From her head down to her toenails
 (Down to her feet, yeah)
 And she'll wait for me at backstage
 With her girlfriends
 In a limousine
 (Going back in Chinatown)

 Three's not a crowd to her, she says
 (Manaja trois)
 Room 714, I'll be waiting
 When I get there she's got incense
 Wine and candles
 It's such a freaky scene

 That girl is pretty kinky
 (The girl's a super freak)
 I really love to taste her
 (Every time we meet)
 She's all right, she's all right
 That girl's all right
 With me, yeah
 Hey, hey, hey-heeeey

 She's a super freak, super freak
 She's super-freaky, yow

 Temptations sing
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oooooh
 Super freak, super freak
 That girl's a super freak
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oooooh

 She's a very kinky girl
 The kind you don't take home to mother
 She will never let your spirits down
 Once you get her off the street
