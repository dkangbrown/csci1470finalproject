[Verse]

D             
Well I don't know why I came here tonight,
D
I got the feeling that something ain't right,
       G7
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
        D
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs,
A
Clowns to the left of me,
C             G
Jokers to the right, here I am,
D
  Stuck in the middle with you.


[Chorus]

D
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you,
D
And I'm wondering what it is I should do,
        G7
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face,
          D
Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place,
A
Clowns to the left of me,
C             G
Jokers to the right, here I am,
D
  Stuck in the middle with you.


[Bridge]

         G7
Well you started out with nothing,
                                              D
And you're proud that you're a self made man,
         G7
And your friends, they all come crawlin, Slap you on the back and say,
D          G7
Please.... Please.....


[Verse]

D
Trying to make some sense of it all,
D
But I can see that it makes no sense at all,
      G7
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor,
               D
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore
A
Clowns to the left of me,
C             G
Jokers to the right, here I am,
D
  Stuck in the middle with you.

D
Well I don't know why I came here tonight,
          D
I got the feeling that something ain't right,
       G7
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
        D
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs,
A
Clowns to the left of me,
C             G
Jokers to the right, here I am,
D
  Stuck in the middle with you.
       D
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you,
          D                             
Here I am, Stuck in the middle with you.
