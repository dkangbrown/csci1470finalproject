[Chorus]

A                                        
Well they call me the fireman,
D            A
That's my name,
A                                           
Making my rounds all over town
A                   E
Putting out old flames.
E     A                                              
Well everybody like to have a what I got,
A      D                                                              

I can cool 'em down when they're smouldering hot
D        A
I'm the fireman,
E            A
That's my name.


[Verse 1]

A
Last night they had a bad one
A E                            A
A mile or two down the road,
A 
Well my buddy walked out
A                                                   E
And left his woman burning out of control.
E     A                                              
Well I was down there in about a hour or so,
A        D                                                    
With a little mouth to mouth she was ready to go
D        A
I'm the fireman,
E            A
That's my name.

[Verse 2]

A                              E                 A
I got a fire engine red T-bird automobile,
A                                                         E
In a minute or less I can be dressed fit to kill.
E       A
I work twenty-four on and twenty-four off,
A              D
When they get too hot they just give me a call
D        A
I'm the fireman,

That's my name.
