[Root] C

G                             C              G
There was a time when I could drink my cares away
                                  Ab  A                    D
And drown out all of the heartaches   that hurt me night & day
          G                                  C             G
When the thought of you came crashin' through I'd have one more
                           D         G
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

       C                            G
I need one good honky tonk angel to turn my life around
                         E         A               D
That's reason enough for me to lay this old bottle down
  G                       C                G
A woman warm & willing is what I'm looking for
                           D        G
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin anymore

They knew my name at every bar in town
                               Ab  A                 D
And they knew all of the reasons   why I was comming round

round round    (sing it Travis)
       G          C              G                    C
'Cause in my mind peace I'd find when they'd start to pour
             G             D            G
But now the whiskey ain't workinm' anymore   (sing it Slim)

                         E         A                D
That's reason enough for me to lay this ol' bottle down
        G                               C                 G
Well a woman warm & willing Lord that's what I'm lookin' for
                          D          G
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
C        G              D          G
Lord the whiskey ain't workin' anymore

That's for sure!
