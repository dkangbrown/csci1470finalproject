[Verse]

 G                                                    F
   I was a little too tall, coulda' used a few pounds
 C                                    F
   Tight pants, points, hardly renown
 G                                                  F
   She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
 C                                            F  G  F  C                       F
   And points all her own sittin' way up high             way up firm and high
 G                                                    F
   Out past the cornfields, where the woods got heavy
 C                                       F
   Out in the backseat of my sixty Chevy
 G                                       F   C
   Workin on mysteries without any clues


[Chorus]

   C       D      Em          D  C
   Working on our night moves
   C         D         Em            D        C
   Tryin' to make some    front page drive-in news
   C       D      Em          D   C   G                   F  C      F
   Workin' on our night moves           in the summertime      hmm
 G                          F  C  F
   In the sweet, summertime


[Verse]

 G                                        F
   We weren't in love, oh no, far from it
 C                                                     F
   We weren't searching for some pie in the sky summit
 G                                           F  C                     F
   We were just young and restless and bored      living by the sword
 G                                           F
   And we'd steal away every chance we could 
 C                                              F
   To the back room, alley, or the trusty woods
 G                                               F  C
   I used her, she used me but neither one cared      we were getting our share


[Chorus]

   C       D      Em          D  C
   Working on our night moves
   C         D        Em         D       C
   Tryin' to lose the    awkward teenage blues 
   C       D      Em          D  C  G                   F  C     F
   Workin' on our night moves         in the summertime      hmm
 G                                 F    C  F
   In the sweet, summertime, summertime
