[Root] D

[Intro]
D                            G        D
The night was clear, and the moon was yellow..
        A7                   D
And the leaves came tumblin' down... 

[Verse 1]
(fast, rock.)
D                     D7
I was standin' on the corner,
      G7
When I heard my bull dog bark.
       D
He was barkin' at the two men
         A7              D   
Who were gamblin' in the dark.
D                      D7
It was Stagger Lee and Billy,
    G7
Two men who gambled late.
D
Stagger lee threw a seven,
      A7                   D
Billy swore that he threw eight.

[Verse 2]
D                 D7
Stagger Lee, said Billy,
        G7
I can't let you go with that.
         D
You have won all my money,
       A7                D
And my brand-new Stetson hat.
D
Stagger Lee went home,
       G7
And he got his forty-four.
             D
He said, I'm goin' to the barroom
        A7             D
Just to pay that debt I owe.
 A7
(Go, Stagger Lee.)

[Verse 3]
D                       D7
Stagger Lee went to the barroom,
       G7
And he stood across the barroom door.
         D                  A7           D
He said, Nobody move, and he pulled his .44.
D                  D7
Stagger Lee, cried Billy,
    G7
Oh, please don't take my life!
        D
I've got three little children,
      A7          D
And a very sickly wife.

[Verse 4]
D                D7
Stagger Lee shot Billy.
       G7
Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad..
         D
That the bullet went through Billy
    A7                    D  
And broke the bartender's glass.
 A7
(Look out now.)

[Outro]
D               D7               G7
Go, Stagger Lee..go, Stagger Lee..go, Stagger Lee..
                 D   A7 D
Go, Stagger Lee..go, go...Fade.
