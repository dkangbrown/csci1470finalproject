Well, since my baby left me,

I found a new place to dwell.
                        E7
It�s down at the end of lonely street
   E
At heartbreak hotel.

You make me so lonely baby,

I get so lonely,
B7                      E
I get so lonely I could die.

      E
And although its always crowded,

You still can find some room.
             E7
Where broken hearted lovers
   E
Do cry away their gloom.

Well, the bell hops tears keep flowin,

And the desk clerks dressed in black.
                          E7
Well they been so long on lonely street
     E
They ain�t ever gonna look back.

I get so lonely,
B7                      E
I get so lonely I could die.

Hey now, if your baby leaves you,

And you got a tale to tell.
                      E7
Just take a walk down lonely street
   E
To heartbreak hotel.

A7
You make me so lonely baby,

I get so lonely,
B7                      E
I get so lonely I could die.
