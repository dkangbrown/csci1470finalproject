[Root] D

D             G         A           D
lord almighty i feel my temperature rising
D                 G            A             D
higher and higher it's burning through to my soul
D              G            A         D
girl girl girl you're gonna set me on fire
D                   G            A            D
my brain is flaming i don't know which way to go

(chorus)
Bm          A       G
your kisses lift me higher
Bm                  A      G
like the sweet song of the choir
Bm           A       G
you blind my morning sky
A            D
with burning love

ooh ooh ooh i feel my temperature rising
help me baby my fever's a 109
burnin burnin burnin and nothing can cool me down
i might turn to smoke but baby i feel fine

(chorus)

it's coming closer the flames are licking my body
won't you help me i feel i'm slipping away
it's hard to breath my chest is a heaving
lord have mercy i'm burning the whole day

(chorus)

i'm a hunka hunka burning love
(repeat and fade)
