O-h, yes  I'm the great  pre-tender, (ooh, ooh).
   |C                       |G      G7
Pre-tending  that I'm  doing well, (ooh, ooh).
  |C        D          |G         C
My need  is such  I pre-tend  too much.
   |G           D7         |G    D
I'm lonely  but no  one can tell.

I play  the game  but to my  real shame.

You've left me  to dream  all a-lone, (ooh, ooh).

   |C                         |G (2/4)         |D    
Too real  when I feel  what my heart  can't con-ceal.
