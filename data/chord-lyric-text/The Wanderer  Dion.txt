[Root] D

       D
  Well I`m the type of guy who will never settle down.

  Where pretty girls are, well you know that I`m around.
    G
  I kiss `em and I love `em, cause to me they`re all the same.
    D
  I hug `em and I squeeze `em, they don`t even know my name.


[Chorus]

                   A                   G
  They call me the wanderer, yeah, the wanderer,
         D                              A7
  I roam around, around, around, around.


[Verse]

                 D
  Well, there is Bo on my left arm and there`s Mary on my right.

  And Jenny is the girl, well, that I`ll be with tonight.
      G
  And when she asked me which one I love the best
    D
  I tear over my shirt and show her Rosie on my chest.


[Chorus]

                A                   G
  Cause I`m the wanderer, yeah, the wanderer,
          D
  I roam around, around, around, around.


[Bridge]

          A
  Well, I roam from town to town,

  I got a life without a care.

  And I`m as happy as a clown,
              B7                        E7            A7
  I`m with my two fists of iron but I`m going nowhere.


[Verse]

        D
  Yeah, I`m the type of guy that likes to roam around.

  I`m never in one place, I roam from town to town.
      G
  And when I find myself falling for some girl,
    D
  I hop right into that car of mine, I drive around the world.


[Chorus]

                A                   G
  Yeah, I`m the wanderer, yeah, the wanderer,
         D                              A7
  I roam around, around, around, around.


[Verse]

           D
  Oh yeah, I`m the type of guy that likes to roam around.

  I`m never in one place, I roam from town to town.
      G
  and when I find myself falling for some girl,
    D
  I hop right into that car of mine, I drive around the world.


[Chorus]

                A                  G
  Cause I`m the wanderer,yeah, the wanderer,
          D
  I roam around, around, around, around.


  Repead and fade out
