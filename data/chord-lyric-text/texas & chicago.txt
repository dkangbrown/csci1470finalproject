TEXAS FLOOD

Well there's floodin' down in Texas
All of the telephone lines are down X2
And I've been tryin' to call my baby
Lord and I can't get a single sound

Well dark clouds are rollin' in
Man I'm standin' out in the rain
Yeah flood water keep a rollin'
Man it's about to drive poor me insane

Well I'm leavin' you baby
Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay
Well back home are no floods or tornados
Baby and the sun shines every day

SWEET HOME CHICAGO

Come on Oh baby don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place Sweet home Chicago

Come on Baby don't you wanna go
Hidehey Baby don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place Oh sweet home Chicago

Well, one and one is two

Come on baby don't ya make me late
Hidehey Baby don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place Sweet home Chicago
