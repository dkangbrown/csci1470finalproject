          C7                    F7
          Seems I got to have a change of scene
          C7                           F7
          Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
          C7                       F7
          Imprisoned by the way it could've been
          C7                     F7
          Left here on my own or so it seems
          C7                      F7
          I got to leave before I start to scream
          C7                                F7
          But someone's locked the door and took the key
 
                  C7           F7
          Feelin' alright
                          C7                 F7
          Not feelin' too good myself
                  C7           F7
          Feelin' alright
                          C7                 F7
          Not feelin' too good myself
 
 
          Boy you sure took me for one big ride
 
          Even now I sit and wonder why
 
          And when I think of you I start to cry
 
          I just can't waste the time I must keep dry
 
          Got to stop believin' in all your lies
 
          Cause I got to much to do before I die
 
 
           Don't get too lost in all I say
 
          If half the time I really felt that way
 
          That was then and now it's today
 
          Can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay
 
          Before someone comes along and takes my place
 
          With a different name and yes a different face
