[Root] Am

[Verse]
Am
Once was a sweet thing, baby
Am
Held that love in our hands
Am
But now I reach to kiss your lips
Am
It just don't mean a thing


[Chorus]
Dm
And that's a cold shot, baby
Dm                Am
Yeah that's a drag
Dm
A cold shot, babe
E7
I've let our love go bad


[Verse]
Am
Remember the way that you loved me
Am
Do anything I say
Am
Now I see you out somewhere 
Am
You won't give me the time of day


[Chorus]
Dm
And that's a cold shot, girl
Dm                 Am
Yeah that's a drag 
Dm
That's a cold shot, babe 
E7
We've let our love go bad


[Verse]
Am
I really meant I was sorry
Am
For ever causing you pain
Am
You showed your appreciation
Am
By walking out anyway


[Chorus]
Dm
And that's a cold shot, baby
Dm                 Am
Yeah that's a drag 
Dm
That's a cold shot, babe
E7
We've let our love go bad

Am
So sad...
Too bad...
So sad...
E7
[spoken] Don't let our true love run cold
