A            E             
Hello there, my old friend 
F#m                      D   
Not so long ago, it was 'till the end
A                          E            
We played out side, in the pourin' rain 
F#m                     D 
On our way up the road, we started over again


[Chorus]

F#m                  D      E
Livin' the dream, of you on top
F#m                  D      E
My mind is achin', and lord it wont stop
F#m             D7               E           A
That's how it's happened, livin' Life by the drop


[Verse]

A                             E
Up and down that road, in our worn out shoes 
F#m                            D
Talkin' 'bout good things, and singin' the blues
A                      E
You went your way, and I stayed behind
F#m                         D
We both knew, it was just a matter of time


[Chorus]

A                             E
No waste of time, we're allowed today
F#m                            D
Churnin' up the past, there's no easier way
A                             E
Times been between us, a means to an end
F#m                                   D7
God, It's good to be here, walkin' together my friend

F#m                 D-0-2-2h4-2--2h4p2-0    
Livin' the dream!
F#m                 D-0-2-2h4-2--2h4p2-0
My mind stoped achin'!
F#m             D7               E           A
That's how it's happened, livin' Life by the drop
F#m             D7               E           A
That's how it's happened, livin' Life by the drop
