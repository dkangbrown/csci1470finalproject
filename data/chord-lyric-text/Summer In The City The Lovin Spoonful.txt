[verse 1]
Am          Am/G                D/F#                    F         E
  Hot town, summer in the city; back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Am           Am/G             D/F#                 F             E
  Been down, isn't it a pity; doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
E              E7
  All around, people looking half dead
Am                       A
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head


[chorus]
D                     G
  But at night it's a different world
D            G
  Go out and find a girl
D                      G
  Come-on come-on and dance all night
D                        G
  Despite the heat it'll be alright
    Bm              E
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
         Bm         E
That the days can't be like the nights
       Bm             E
In the summer, in the city
       Bm             E
In the summer, in the city


[verse 2]

Am          Am/G                D/F#                    F         E
Cool town, evening in the city; Dressing so fine and looking so pretty
Am           Am/G             D/F#                 F             E
Cool cat, looking for a kitty; Gonna look in every corner of the city
E                   E7
Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop
Am                       A
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop

  Despite the heat it'll be alright
    Bm              E
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
         Bm         E
That the days can't be like the nights
       Bm             E
In the summer, in the city
       Bm             E
In the summer, in the city
