[Verse 1]
Get out in that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
    A                                             E
Get out in that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans

I want my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man

[Chorus]
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll

I said, Shake, rattle and roll
        E
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
    B7                  A                 E
You never do nothin' to save your doggone soul

[Verse 2]
You're wearin' those dresses, your hair done up so nice
You're wearin' those dresses, your hair done up so nice
You look so warm but your heart is cold as ice

I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll

I said, Shake, rattle and roll

You never do nothin' to save your doggone soul

[Verse 3]
I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a seafood store
I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a seafood store
I can look at you and tell you don't love me no more

[Verse 4]
I believed you were doin' me wrong, and now I know
I believed you were doin' me wrong, and now I know
The more I work, the faster my money goes

[Chorus]
I said, Shake, rattle and roll
I said, Shake, rattle and roll

You never do nothin' to save your doggone soul
