[Root] A

A                                D
She came in through the bathroom window
A                     D
Protected by a silver spoon
A                               D
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
                          A
By the banks of her own lagoon

A              Dm      
Didn't anybody tell her?
A              Dm
Didn't anybody see?

A                             D     
She said she'd always been a dancer
A                             D    
She worked in fifteen clubs a day
A                                 D
And though she thought I knew the answer
                             A
Well, I knew but I could not say

A                          D       
And so I quit the police department
A                       D   
And got myself a steady job
    A                            D
And though she tried her best to help me
                                  A
She could steal but she could not rob

A              Dm      
Didn't anybody tell her?
A              Dm
Didn't anybody see?
