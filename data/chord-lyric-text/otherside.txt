[Chorus]

Am            F            C       
How long how long will I slide     
   G         Am  F    C            
Separate my side   I don't          
    G                Am F          
I don't believe it's bad         
   C                   G               
Slit my throat it's all I ever

    
[Verse]

Am                            Em
I heard your voice through a photograph
Am                          Em
I thought it up and brought up the past
Am                     Em
Once you know you can never go back 
             G              Am
I've got to take it on the other side

Am                     Em   
Centuries are what it meant to me
Am                  Em 
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Am                           Em
Stranger things could never change my mind
             G              Am
I've got to take it on the other side
 G              Am
Take it on the other side
 G          Am
Take it on   take it on


[Chorus]

Am            F            C       
How long how long will I slide     
   G         Am  F    C            
Separate my side   I don't          
    G                Am F          
I don't believe it's bad         
   C                   G               
Slit my throat it's all I ever


[Verse] 
 
  Am                   Em 
Pour my life into a paper cup
Am                          Em
The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
Am                      Em  
She wants to know am I still a slut  
             G              Am
I've got to take it on the other side

Am                         Em
Scarlet starlet and she is in my bed
Am                  Em      
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Am                   Em
Push the trigger and pull the thread
                G              Am
I've got to take it on the other side
 G              Am 
Take it on the other side
 G          Am           
Take it on take it on


[Chorus]

Am            F            C       
How long how long will I slide     
   G         Am  F    C            
Seperate my side   I don't          
    G                Am F          
I don't believe it's bad         
   C                   G               
Slit my throat it's all I ever


[Instrumental]

 Em C x 2  

 
[Bridge]

   Em
Turn me on take me for a hard ride
C
Burn me out leave me on the other side
   Em
I fell and tell it that it's not my friend 
           C
I tear it down I tear it down 
                    Am F C G
And it's born again 


 [Chorus]

Am            F            C       
How long how long will I slide     
   G         Am  F    C            
Separate my side   I don't          
    G                Am F          
I don't believe it's bad         
   C                   G               
Slit my throat it's all I ever


[Outro]

Am   F      C       G                 Am  F
How long I don't I don't believe it's bad
C                    G          Am
Slit my throat it's all I ever
