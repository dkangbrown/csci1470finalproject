I was stuck outside of Memphis 
In an Arkie jail
Jammed up outside of Memphis 
In an Arkie jail
Called up that big old woman 
She wouldn't pay my bail

When I finally got out
I started walking on down the road 
Yeah, when I finally got out 
I started walking on down the road 
My poor old back was breaking
From such a heavy load

Chorus
I been walkin' 55 with my suitcase in my hand
Headed down south to orleans to see the Promised land 
Devil on my shoulder, gonna take me if he can

Went down to the Quarter 
I was looking for a fight 
Yeah,  I took a streetcar to the Quarter 
I was spoiling for a fight
That big man down on Toulouse
Done put out my light

REPEAT CHORUS

Well, now I'm back on 55, I got no shoes upon my feet
Lost them, my clothes, my suitcase down Bourbon Street
Going back to see my baby, going back home again
