[Root] D


D
People say I'm no good and crazy as a loon

Cause I get stoned in the mornin, get drunk in the afternoon

Kinda like my ole blue tick hound I like to lay around in the shade
                                              
I ain't got no money but I've damn sure got it made

Chorus
            G
And I ain't askin' nobody for nothing
                        D
If I can't get it on my own
             A
If you don't like the way I'm livin'
          G                                                   D
You just leave this long haired country boy alone

verse 2
D
Poor girl wants to marry and rich girls want to flirt

Rich man goes to college and poor man goes to work

Drunkard wants another drink of wine and the politician wants a vote
                                                           
I don't want much of nothing at all but I will take another toke

Chorus 

verse 3

Preacher man talkin' on the radio, puttin' down the rock and roll
He wants me to give a donation cause he's worried about my soul
He said Jesus walked on the water and I know that it's true
But sometimes I think that preacher man might do a little walkin' too
