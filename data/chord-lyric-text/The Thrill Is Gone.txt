[Root] Bm

    Bm                                 
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
    Em                                Bm
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
 G                 F#7                      Bm  
You done me wrong baby And you're gonna be sorry someday


[Verse 2]

     Bm                         
The thrill is gone, it's gone away from me
    Em                                Bm
The thrill is gone, the thrill has gone away from me
 G                     F#7           Bm  
Although I�ll still live on, But so lonely I'll be


[Verse 3]

     Bm                         
The thrill is gone, it's gone away for good
       Em                                       Bm
Oh, the thrill is gone, baby it's gone away for good
 G                           F#7                    Bm  
Someday I know I'll be open armed baby, just like I know a good man should


[Verse 4]

             Bm                        
You know I�m free, free now baby, I�m free from your spell

Em                                 Bm
Oh, I�m free, free, free, now, I�m free from your spell
    G                    F#7          Bm  
And now that it�s all over, all I can do is wish you well
