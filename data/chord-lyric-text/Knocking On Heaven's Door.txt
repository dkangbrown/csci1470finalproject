[Verse]

G              D            Am7
Mama take this badge off of me
G       D          C
I can't use it any-more
G            D                        Am7
It's getting dark, too dark for me to see
G          D                   C   
I feel I'm knockin on heaven's door
 
 
[Chorus]

G             D                    Am7
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    Am7
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door


[Verse] 
 
G           D           Am7
Mama put my guns in the ground
G       D              C
I can't shoot them any-more
G               D               Am7
That long black cloud is comin' down
G          D                    C   
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door
 

[Chorus]

G             D                    Am7
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    Am7
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G             D                    C   
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
