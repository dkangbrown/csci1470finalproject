[Root] Am

[Verse 1]

Am                           Am     Em G Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
Am                        Am        Em G Am
It's not warm when she's away.
                             Em                              Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and she's always gone too long,
                  Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.

Am                           Am     Em G Am
Wonder this time where she's gone,
Am                      Am       Em G Am
Wonder if she's gone to stay
                             Em                                 Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home,
                  Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.



[Verse 2]

                                  Am      Em G Am
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                                  Am      Em G Am
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Am                  Am      Em G Am
only darkness everyday.
                             Em                                 Dm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
                 Am      Em G Am
Anytime she goes away.
