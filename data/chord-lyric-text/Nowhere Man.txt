[Verse]

E            B
He's a real nowhere man
A              E
Sitting in his nowhere land
F#m             Am               E             
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
E              B             A           E
Doesn't have a point of view.Knows not where he's going to
F#m            Am            E           E         
Isn't he a bit like you and me


[Chorus]

G#m            A             G#m         A
Nowhere man please listen. You don't know what you're missing
G#m            F#m7                        B7        
Nowhere man the world is at your command   Ah lalalalala


[Solo]

E              B             A           E
F#m            Am            E           E         


[Verse 2](Same as Verse 1)

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all

Take your time don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand
