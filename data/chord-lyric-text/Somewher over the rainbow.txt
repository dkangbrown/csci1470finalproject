Verse
F         Am
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bb         F
   Way up high
Bb       F
And the dreams that you dream of
C          Dm      Bb
Once in a lullaby...

     F        Am
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bb             F
   Blue birds fly
Bb        F
And the dreams that you dream of
C                     Dm    Bb
Dreams really do come true...

     F
Someday I'll wish upon a star
C                                  Dm   Bb
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      F
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
C
High above the chimney tops
       Dm           Bb
That's where you'll find me
    F         Am
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bb             F
   Blue birds fly
Bb       F
And the dream that you dare to
C               Dm   Bb
Why oh why can't I...

     F
Someday I'll wish upon a star
C                                  Dm   Bb
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      F
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
C
High above the chimney tops
       Dm           Bb
That's where you'll find me
    F         Am
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bb          F
   Way up high
Bb       F
And the dreams that you dare to
Bb      C         Dm   Bb
Why oh why can't I
