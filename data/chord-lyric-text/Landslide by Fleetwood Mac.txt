[Verse]


C           G/B                Am7         G/B
I took my love and I took it down
C           G/B              Am7           G/B
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
      C            G/B            Am7            G/B
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
           C          G/B         Am7
Until the landslide brought me down

    C            G/B
Oh mirror in the sky 
        Am7      G/B
What is love
        C              G/B
Can the child within my heart
Am7        G/B
Rise Above
      C                G/B
Can I sail through the changing 
Am7             G/B
Ocean Tides
       C             G/B      Am7        G
Can I handle all the season of my life


[Pre-Chorus]

 C            G/B
mmm... mmm...
       Am7
I dont know
          G/B     
mmm.... mmm...


[Chorus]

     C            G/B           Am7
Well Ive been afraid of changing 
G/B       Am7             G/B    
Cause I built my life around you 
 C                G/B  
But time makes you bolder
Am7           G/B 
Children get older
 C              G/B      Am7     G/B
I am getting older too


[Chorus]

     C            G/B           Am7
Well Ive been afraid of changing 
G/B       Am7             G/B    
Cause I built my life around you 
 C                G/B  
But time makes you bolder
Am7           G/B 
Children get older
 C              G/B      Am7     G/B
I am getting older too


[Verse]

C          G/B            Am7     G/B
Take this love and take it down
  C             G/B            Am7          G/B
If you climb a mountain and you turn around 
         C          G/B         
And if you see my reflection in the
Am7          G/B         C           Am7           G/B 
Snow covered hills then a landslide will bring you down

            C           G/B       
And if you see my relfection in the
Am7            G/B           C
Snow covered hills well maybe...

 G/B           Am7          G/B
A landslide will bring you down
C            G/B          Am7        G/B
Well well a landslide bring ya down
