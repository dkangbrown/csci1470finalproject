D         C            G        D
There are stars in the southern sky
          C      G  D
Southward as you go
         C             G           D
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
               C       G   D
Down the seven bridges road

    D      C         G      D
Now I have loved you like a baby
          C        G    D
Like some lonesome child
           C     G        D
And I have loved you in a tame way
           C         G   D
And I have loved you wild

    C               D
Sometimes there's a part of me
       C                  D
Has to turn from here and go
C                         D
Running like a child from these warm stars
               C       G   D
Down the seven bridges road

D         C            G        D
There are stars in the southern sky
                  C               G D
And if ever you decide you should go
           C        G              D
There is a taste of time sweetened honey
               C       G   D
Down the seven bridges road
