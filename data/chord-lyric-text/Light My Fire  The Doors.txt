[Verse]

    Am                      F#m
You know that it would be untrue 
    Am                     F#m
You know that I would be a liar 
Am                 F#m
If I was to say to you 
Am                         F#m
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

    Am                  F#m
The time to hesitate is through 
   Am                    F#m
No time to wallow in the mire 
Am                  F#m
Try now we can only lose 
Am                            F#m
And our love become a funeral pyre 


[Chorus]
