I was all right for a while,

I could smile for a while

But I saw you last night,
            D+
you held my hand so tight,
       G                 Gm
as you stopped to say hello
        D                   A7
Oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell,

that I'd been . .

D      F#m
Crying over you
D      F#m
Crying over you
     G           A
Then you said so long,
        G             A
left me standing all alone
          D       D+      G       Gm
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
             D
It's hard to understand,
        A7
but the touch of your hand,
             D
can start me crying

D
I thought that I, was over you,

but it's true, so true

I love you even more,
       D+
than I did before
    G                   Gm
But darling, what can I do?
          D                   
Cause you don't love me,
         A7
and I'll always be

D      F#m
Crying over you
D      F#m
Crying over you
G               A
Yes, now you're gone
G                    A
And from this moment on
        D       D+      G       Gm
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying

    D       Bm
I'm crying, crying
G        A7   D
Oh-oh-oh-over you

A7 D G D
