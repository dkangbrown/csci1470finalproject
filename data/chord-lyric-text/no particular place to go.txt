                         G   
Riding along in my automobile
                              
My baby beside me at the wheel
                                C   
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
                     G   
My curiosity running wild
                             D 
Cruising and playing the radio
                            G  
With no particular place to go.

                         G   
Riding along in my automobile
                                         
I was anxious to tell her the way I feel,
                            C   
So I told her softly and sincere,
                                   G  
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
                          D    
Cuddling more and driving slow,
                            G  
With no particular place to go.

                       G  
No particular place to go,
                                  
So we parked way out on the Kokomo
                                     C   
The night was young and the moon was gold
                             G     
So we both decided to take a stroll
                          D    
Can you imagine the way I felt?
                               G    
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt!

                       G    
Riding along in my calaboose
                                  
Still trying to get her belt loose
                          C      
All the way home I held a grudge,
                                  G    
For the safety belt that wouldn't budge
                             D 
Cruising and playing the radio
                            G  
With no particular place to go.
