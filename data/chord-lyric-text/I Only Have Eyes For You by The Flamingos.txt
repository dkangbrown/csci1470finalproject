[Intro]

Bb7, G  D,

C             Bbmaj7       C          Bbmaj7
 My love must be a kind of blind love,
C        Bbmaj7         C   Bbmaj7
 I can't see anyone but you.


[Interlude]

C  Bbmaj7 (x4)


[Verse 1]

C        Bbmaj7    C       Bbmaj7
 Are the stars out tonight?
C        Bbmaj7                 C      C7
 I don't know if it's cloudy or bright.


[Chorus 1]

  Fmaj7               Am7  Ab7
I only have eyes, for you, dear.


[Verse 2]

C    Bbmaj7   C       Bbmaj7
 The moon may be high,
C            Bbmaj7             C   C7
 But I can't see a thing in the sky;


[Chorus 2]

  Fmaj7               D7
I only have eyes, for you.


[Bridge 1]

Gm7      C                  Fmaj7  F7
 I don't know if we're in a garden,
Bbmaj7   Bbm7         F  Db9
 Or on a crowded aven-ue.


[Verse 3]

C        Bbmaj7    C       Bbmaj7
 You are here, and so am I;
C      Bbmaj7              C     C7
 Maybe millions of people, go by.


[Chorus 3]

         Fmaj7               D7
But they all disappear, from view.

      Gm7            C (n.C) (C)
And I only have eyes,     for you...


[Outro]
