[Root] A

A                      E                    D                                           A
When you can't find the light, that got you through the cloudy days,
A                      E                    D                                          A
When the stars ain't shinin' bright, you feel like you've lost you're way,
A                        E                   D                     A
When those candle lights of home, burn so very far away,
A                        E                          F#m                        G
Well you got to let your soul shine, just like my daddy used to say.

[Chorus]
                          A                                    E
He used to say soulshine, it's better than sunshine,
                          D                                    A
It's better than moonshine, damn sure better than rain.
                A                               E
Hey now people don't mind, we all get this way sometime,
                         F#m          G                      A
Got to let your soul shine, shine till the break of day.

I grew up thinkin' that I had it made, gonna make it on my own.
Life can take the strongest man, make him feel so alone.
Now and then I feel a cold wind, blowin' through my achin' bones,
I think back to what my daddy said, he said "Boy, in the darkness before the dawn:"

[Chorus]

F#m                              D
Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness,
       D                                            A
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul.
  C#m                             D
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this.
G                                                E
And when your world seems cold, you got to let your spirit take control.
