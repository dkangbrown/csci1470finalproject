[Root] C

[Verse 1]

         C        Em            Am         Am
Are you lonesome tonight, do you miss me tonight?
         C        C7          F  F
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
           G      G            G7           G7
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
         G7             G7            C     C
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
        C7              C7          F         F
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
       D            D            Dm           G
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
        C                 Em           D           D
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
        Dm            G7        C    G7
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight.


[Verse 2]

(Talking verses,play the same chords)

C        Em            Am         
I wonder if   you are lonesome tonight
          Am                               C
You know someone said that the world is a stage

And you must play a part.
C7         F                                F     
Fate had me playing in love twes my sweet heart.
                           G        
Act one was when I met you, I loved you at first glance
              G7                                   G7
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a 'q'
                G7             G7                        C                
Then came act 2, you seemed to change and you acted strange

And why I'll never know.
C7               C7                         F 
Honey, you're lying when you said you loved me
          F                         
And I had no cause to doubt you.
       D            D                                          
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Dm           G    
Than go on living without you.
C               Em                      D
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
D                           Dm        
With emptiness all around
                      G7             
And if you won't come back to me
C                                     G7
Then make them bring the curtain down.

         (sing again)               
   C                 Em           D           D
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
        Dm            G7        C    G7
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight.
