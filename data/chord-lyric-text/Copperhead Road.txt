[Verse]

 D
 Well my name's John Lee Pettimore

 Same as my daddy and his daddy before
 D
 You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here

 He only came to town about twice a year
 D
 He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line

 Everybody knew that he made moonshine
            G                  C       G
 Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
 D
 He headed up the holler with everything he had
        G                  C         G
 It's before my time but I've been told
 D
 He never came back from Copperhead Road


[INTRO RIFF]


[Verse]

 D
 Now Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge

 Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
 D
 Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side

 Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
 D
 Well him and my uncle tore that engine down

 I still remember that rumblin' sound
             G                         C             G
 Well the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
 D
 Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
          G                                 C      G
 He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
 D (LET RING)
 You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road

[Verse]

 D
 I volunteered for the Army on my birthday

 They draft the white trash first,'round here anyway
 D
 I done two tours of duty in Vietnam

 And I came home with a brand new plan
 D
 I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico

 I plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
            G              C             G
 Well the D.E.A.'s got a chopper in the air
 D
 I wake up screaming like I'm back over there
      G                               C               G
 I learned a thing or two from ol' Charlie don't you know
 D
 You better stay away from Copperhead Road
