[Verse]

Dm
Here come old flat top, He come grooving up slowly,
Dm
He got Joo Joo eyeball, He one holy roller 
        A7              
He got  Hair down to his knee;  
G7
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please.

[Verse]

Dm
He bag production, He got wal-rus gumboot

Come together, right now,  over me

Dm
He roller coaster, he got early warning

He got muddy water, He one Mo-jo filter
        A7
He say, " One and one and one is three."
G7
Got to be good looking 'cause he so hard to see 


[Chorus]

     Bm
Come together, Right now, over me
