[Intro]

 A   F#m   D   E   A

[Verse 1]
         
When the night has come
F#m
  And the land is dark
            D         E                 A
And the moon is the only light we'll see

No, I won't be afraid,
      F#m
No, I won't be afraid
            D            E             A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.


[Chorus]

So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    F#m
Oh, stand by me.
    D     E           A
Oh, stand, stand by me,
Stand by me.


[Verse 2]
       
If the sky that we look upon
F#m
Should tumble and fall
            D         E                 A
Or the mountain should crumble in the sea,

I won't cry, I won't cry,
      F#m
No, I won't shed a tear
            D            E             A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.


[Chorus]

So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    F#m
Oh, stand by me.
    D     E           A
Oh, stand, stand by me,
Stand by me.
