Ain't but one way out baby, lord I just can't go out the door.
D                                                        A
Ain't but one way out baby, lord I just can't go out the door.
                E                D                        A

Lord you got me trapped woman, up on the second floor;
If I get by this time I won't be trapped no more.
D                                                 A
So raise our window baby, I can ease out soft and slow.
                  E
And lord, your neighbors, no they won't be
D                                  A
Talking that stuff that they don't know.

Lord, I'm foolish to be here in the first place,
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place.
D                                                     A
Ain't no way in the world, I'm going out that front door
                 E              D                           A
Cause there's a man down there, might be your man I don't know.
                 E              D                           A
Cause there's a man down there, might be your man I don't know.
                 E              D                           A
Cause there's a man down there, might be your man I don't know.
