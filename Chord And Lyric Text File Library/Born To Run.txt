In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American Dream
E                                              A               B
At night we ride through mansions of Glory in suicide machines
A                    E                    A                        B

Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
        A                                           F#m             B
Girls comb their hair in rear view mirrors and the boys try to look so hard 
        D                                             F#m   
the amusement park rises bold and stark as kids are huddled on the beach in the mist
              A                                                 F#m         B
