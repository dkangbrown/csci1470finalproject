Loving you,   isn t the right thing to do?
Bb                                      F        
How can I,    ever change things that I feel
F                                   C    Bb
If I could,   maybe I d give you my world
Bb                                       F
How can I,    when you wont take it from me?

Dm      Bb          C 
You can go your own way,     Go your own way
Dm      Bb       C         
You can call it  Another lonely day
Dm      Bb          C 
You can go your own way,   Go your own way

Bb                                          F
Packing up,    shacking up is all you wanna do
F                                    C    Bb
If I could,    baby Id give you my world
Bb                                      F
Open up,       everything s waiting for you

You can go your own way,     Go your own way
Dm      Bb       C         
You can call it  Another lonely day

You can go your own way,   Go your own way
