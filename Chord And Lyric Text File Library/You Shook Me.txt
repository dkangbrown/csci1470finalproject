You know you shook me, you shook me all night long
Whoa you shook me, pretty mama, you shook me all night long
Oh you just kept on shakin' me baby, oh you done messed up my happy home

You know you move me baby, just like a hurricane (Boy and that's a strong wind)
Oh, you move me, pretty mama (You know you move me)
Just like a hurricane (Didn't have a chance)
Oh-oh , you know you move me, pretty mama
Just like a earthquake move the land (Oh, she shook me all over)

Sometimes I wonder (Ooh)
What's gonna happen to my poor wife and child
Lord, sometimes I wonder (Ooh)

Now baby, you done made me love you
Lord, I just can't be satisfied
