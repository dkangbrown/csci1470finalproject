[Intro]

E    A*    A*/ B*  x 8


[Verse]

       E   A*   A*/ B*  C#m            B                   A
Been away,     haven't  seen you in a while.   How've you been?
          C#m     B   C#m       B       E
Have you changed your style and do you think
            C#m               B                    A
That we've grown up differently?   Don't seem the same
              C#m  B    C#m B       E
Seems you've lost your   feel   for me


[Chorus]

             C#m   B    E               C#m       B       E
     So let's leave it alone,  'cause we can't see eye to eye.
     C#m         B        E      C#m        B       E    A
     There ain't no good guys,  there ain't no bad guys.
                  C#m     B      A        B    E
     There's only you and me and we just disagree.
     A     B      C#m       C#m  B    E       A*   A*/ B* x 4
     Ooo - ooo - ooohoo     oh - oh - o-whoa


[Verse]

I'm going back to a place that's far away.   How bout you?
Have you got a place to stay?   Why should I care?
When I'm just trying to get along    We were friends
But now it's the end of our love song...


[Chorus]

             C#m   B    E               C#m       B       E
     So let's leave it alone,  'cause we can't see eye to eye.
     C#m         B        E      C#m        B       E    A
     There ain't no good guys,  there ain't no bad guys.
                  C#m     B      A        B    E
     There's only you and me and we just disagree.
     A     B      C#m       C#m  B    E       A*   A*/ B* x 4
     Ooo - ooo - ooohoo     oh - oh - o-whoa
