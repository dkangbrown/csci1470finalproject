         G
{Verse:} I was talkin' with a friend of mine,

Fmaj9
Said a woman had hurt his pride. 

C
Told him that she loved him so,

    D
And turned around and let him go.

G
Then he said, "You better watch your step

Fmaj9
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself.

C
Someone's gonna tell you lies, 

D
Cut you down to size."

          G                      Fmaj9
{Chorus:} Don't do me like that. Don't do me like that.

Em                         C           D
What if I loved you, baby? Don't do me like that.

G                      Fmaj9
Don't do me like that. Don't do me like that.

Em      
Someday I might need you, baby.

C           D    
Don't do me like that.

         G
{Verse:} Listen, honey, can't you see? 

Fmaj9
Baby, it would bury me

C
If you were in the public eye

D
Givin' someone else a try.

G
And you know you better watch your step

Fmaj9
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself.

C
Someone's gonna tell you lies,

D
Cut you down to size.

          G                      Fmaj9
{Chorus:} Don't do me like that. Don't do me like that.

Em                          C           D
I just might love you baby. Don't do me like that. 

G                      Fmaj9
Don't do me like that. Don't do me like that.

Em                               C           D
Someday I might need you, honey. Don't do me like that.

{Bridge:} Cause somewhere deep down inside, 

C7                       G7                C7
Someone is sayin', "Love doesn't last that long."

G7
I got this feelin' inside,

C7
Night out and day in. 

Cm                            D
Baby, I can't take it no more.

         G
