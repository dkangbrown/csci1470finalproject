(Capo 1st fret.)


[Verse 1]

A                   D
When I was a little girl I had a rag doll.
                    A
Only doll I've ever owned.
                         D
Now, I love you just the way I loved that
          
rag doll.
                         A
But only now my love has grown.
            E                  A
And it gets stronger, in every way.
            E              A
And it gets deeper, let me say.
            E              A
And it gets higher, day by day.


[Chorus]

G
And do I love you, my, oh, my.
      A
Yeah, river deep, mountain high.
G    
If I lost you, would I cry?
    A
Oh, how I love you baby...baby, baby, baby.


[Verse 2]

A                          D
When you were a young boy, did you have a puppy,
                         A
that always followed you around?
                      D
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy.
                       A
No, I'll never let you down.
              E                A 
Cause it goes on, like a river flows.
            E                        A
And it gets bigger, baby, and heaven knows.
            E                   A
And it gets sweeter baby, as it grows.


[Chorus]

    G
And do I love you, my, oh, my.
      A
Yeah, river deep, mountain high.
G    
If I lost you, would I cry?
A
Oh, how I love you baby...baby, baby, baby.


[Verse 3]

A                                              A7
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring.
A
And I love you baby just like a robin loves to sing.
D                                                  D7
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet.
A
And I love you baby, river deep, mountain high.


[Chorus]

    G
And do I love you, my, oh, my.
      A
Yeah, river deep, mountain high.
G    
If I lost you, would I cry?
    A
Oh, how I love you baby...baby, baby, baby.
