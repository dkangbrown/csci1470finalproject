Hey where did we go,
G             D
Days when the rains came
G           C 
Down in the hollow,
G         D
Playin' a new game,
G              C 
Laughing and a running hey, hey
G              D 
Skipping and a jumping
G            C 
In the misty morning fog with
G            D            C,   D
Our hearts a thumpin' and you

You my brown eyed girl.

Whatever happened 
G              D
To Tuesday and so slow 
G              C
Going down the old mine
G                 D 
With a transistor radio
G               C 
Standing in the sunlight laughing,
G               D 
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall,
G            C 
Slipping and sliding
G             D                C       D
All along the water fall, with you

So hard to find my way,
 
Now that I'm all on my own. 

I saw you just the other day,
 
My how you have grown,
 
Cast my memory back there, Lord
 
Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout 

Making love in the green grass 

Behind the stadium with you

Ch 
My brown eyed girl 
You my brown eyed girl 

Do you remember when we used to sing 
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da.
