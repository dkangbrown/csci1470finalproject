[Intro lead]

           Dm
You get a shiver in the dark
         C           Bb       A
it's raining in the park but meantime
Dm                      C           Bb          A
south of the river you stop and you hold everything
F                   C
a band is blowing Dixie double four time
        Bb                                 Dm    Bb - C
you feel alright when you hear that music ring


[Verse 1]

               Dm              C        Bb          A
(Now) you step inside but you don't see too many faces
 Dm                   C                        Bb      A
coming in out of the rain to (you) hear the jazz go down
F                       C
too much competition too many other places
Bb                                    Dm
but not too many horns can make that sound
(But not too many horns are blowing that sound)
Bb - C

        Dm                          C           Bb            A
and a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
Dm                                    C                Bb           A
drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
F                                       C
they don't give a damn about ('bout) any trumpet playing band
   Bb                           Dm      Bb - C
it ain't what they call rock and roll
                Bb - C

Dm                    C         Bb         A
and then the man he steps right up to the microphone
Dm          C                Bb         A    (  )
and says at last just as the time bell rings
F                           C
thank you goodnight now it's time to go home
        Bb                  Dm          Bb - C
and he makes it fast with one more thing
                  Bb - C
we are the sultans
                      Dm           - C - Bb - C
we are the sultans of swing
