[Verse 1]

        C             G           Bb               D
   Come down off your throne, and leave your body lone.

   F   G         D
   Somebody must change.

   C           G                 Bb          D
   You are the reason, I've been waiting so long.

   F   G               D
   Somebody hold's the key.


[Chorus]

             G                   A                  D
   Well I'm, near the end and I, just ain't got the time.

   Em                    G          D6add9 D
   And I'm wasted and I, can't find my way home.
