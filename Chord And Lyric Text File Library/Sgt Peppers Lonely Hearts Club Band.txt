It was twenty years ago today
         C7                        G7
Sergeant Pepper taught the band to play
             G7                  A7
They've been going in and out of style
            C7                    G7
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
   A7
So may I introduce to you
    C7
The act you've known for all these years
G7                C7                  G7
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band

We're Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band
   C7              C7      G7     G7
We hope you will enjoy the show

Sit back and let the evening go

It's wonderful to be here

It's certainly a thrill

        G7                    A7
I don't really wanna stop the show
      C7                        G7
But I thought you might like to know
         G7                    A7
That the singer's gonna sing a song
       C7                     G7
And he wants you all to sing along
   A7
So may I introduce to you
    C7
The one and only Billy Shears
