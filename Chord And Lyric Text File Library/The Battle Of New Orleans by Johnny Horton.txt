In 1814 we took a little trip
 D7                              G
Along with Col. Jackson down the mighty mississip'd
                              C
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
       D7                             G
And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.

   G
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'
                              D7           G
There wasn't as many as there was a while ago

We fired once more and they began to runnin'
                               D7          G
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

   G                            C
We looked down the river and we see'd the British come
          D7                           G
And there musta been a hund'erd of 'em beatin' on the drum 
                              C
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
   D7                                G
We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing. 

   G
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'
                              D7           G
There wasn't as many as there was a while ago

We fired once more and they began to runnin'
                               D7          G
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

    G                     C
Old Hick'ry said we could take 'em by su'prise 
      D7                             G
If we didn't fire our musket till we looked 'em in the eyes 
                         C              
We held our fire till we see'd their faces well 
        D7                               G
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave 'em ... Well -

   G
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'
                              D7           G
There wasn't as many as there was a while ago

We fired once more and they began to runnin'
                               D7          G
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

           G
Yeah! they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
                                        D7              G
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go

They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
                               D7          G
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. 

   G                         C
We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down 
      D7                          G
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
                                        C
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind 
    D7                                  G
And when we touched the powder off, the 'gator lost his mind.
