Rumor spreadin' around, in that Texas town
'Bout that shack outside La Grange
And you know what I'm talkin' about
Just let me know if you wanna go
To that home out on the range
They gotta lotta nice girls

Have mercy
A haw, haw, haw, haw, a haw
A haw, haw, haw

Well, I hear it's fine if you got the time
And the ten to get yourself in, a hmm, hmm
And I hear it's tight most every night
But now I might be mistaken, hmm, hmm, hmm

Have mercy
