D                 G
Rock on gold dust woman
C                       G           D      Daug  D  Daug  D
Take your silver spoon,    dig your grave
          G          C                       G     D  Daug  D
Heartless challenge, pick your path and I'll pray
               G
Wake up in the morning
C                  G             D     Daug  D  Daug  D
See your sunrise - loves - to go down
      G      C
Lousy lovers pick their prey
         G             D      Daug        D
But they never cry out loud    –    cry out


[Chorus]

              Bb                    
Well, did she make you cry
G                         
Make you break down
C                         D
Shatter your illusions of love
          Bb         G
And is it over now - do you know how
C                         D     Daug  D  Daug  D
Pick up the pieces and go home


[Verse]

                G     C                G
Rock on ancient queen follow those who pale
        D       Daug  D  Daug  D
In your shadow
                G
Rulers make bad lovers
C                   G              D     Daug         D
You better put your kingdom up for sale    –   up for sale


[Chorus]

              Bb                    
Well, did she make you cry
G                         
Make you break down
C                         D
Shatter your illusions of love
          Bb         G
And is it over now - do you know how
C                         D
Pick up the pieces and go home


[Chorus]

              Bb                    
Well, did she make you cry
G                         
Make you break down
C                         D
Shatter your illusions of love
          Bb         G
And is it over now - do you know how
C                         D
Pick up the pieces and go home
Daug     D     Daug     D
      Go home,       go home
