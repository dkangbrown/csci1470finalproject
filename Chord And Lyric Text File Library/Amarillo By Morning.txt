[Verse]

D            F#m     G        D
Amarillo by mornin' up from San Antone
They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Sante Fe
D             F#m         G           A     
Everything that I got is just what I got on
Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
G                            A               
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
But I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate
D             A          G
I'll be buckin at the county fair
and I hope that judge ain't blind
D            A         G      A      D
Amarillo by mornin' Amarillo I'll be there  
D           F#m           G           A 
Amarillo by mornin' Amarillo's on my mind

E         G#m             A       E       
Amarillo by mornin' up from San Antone
E             G#m           A         B7
Everything that I got is just what I got on
A                       B7
I ain't got a dime but what I got is mine
          E        G#m        A  
I ain't rich but Lord I'm free
E             B7        A          B7    E A B7
Amarillo by mornin' Amarillo's where I'll be
E             B7         A          B7   E   
Amarillo by mornin' Amarillo's where I'll be
