Lady Luck and four leaf clovers
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occaision
'Til your leaving dampened the situation
I'm standing on Shaky Ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on Shaky Ground
Ever since you put me down
My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
You'd better throw me a life preserver
'Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears
