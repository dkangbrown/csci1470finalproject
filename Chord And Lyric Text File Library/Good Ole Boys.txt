                       E
	Just the good ol' boys
                          A
	Never meaning no harm
           E                              B7
	Beats all you ever saw, been in trouble with the law
                                 E
	Since the day they were born

          E
	Straight in the curves
                      A
	Flat on the hills
          E                          B7
	Someday the mountain might get'em
                           E
	But the law never will


Chorus
          B7
	Making their way,any way they now how
                                                          E
	That's just a little bit more than the law will allow


                      E
	I'm a good ol' boy
                             A
	You know my mama loved me
           E                                  B7
	But she don't understand they keep a showin my hands
                         E
	And not my face on t.v.


              E
	Just the good ol' boys
                          A
	Wouldn't change if they could
           E                              B7                             E
	Fightin' the system like a true modern day Robin Hood.
