[Verse 1]

D                   Am
I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
C                    G
I could be happy the rest of my life
       F        G    C D
With a cinnamon girl.


[Chorus]

D                       Am
A dreamer of pictures I run in the night
    C                G
You see us together, chasing the moonlight,
   F        G    C D
My cinnamon girl.


[Verse 2]

D                   Am
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
C                       G
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
        F        G    C D
For his cinnamon girl.


[Chorus]

D                       Am
A dreamer of pictures I run in the night
    C                G
You see us together, chasing the moonlight,
   F        G    C D
My cinnamon girl.


[Outro]

C
Pa sent me money now,

I'm gonna make it somehow,
               Gm
I need another chance
                           Am  D
You see your baby loves to dance

Yeah...yeah...yeah.
