[Root] D

[Verse 1]

D       A   G    D
I see a bad moon rising
D     A       G     D
I see trouble on the way
D     A    G          D
I see earthquakes and lightning 
D     A   G       D
I see bad times today


[Chorus]

G       
Don't go around tonight
D
'Cause it's bound to take your life
A          G               D
There is a bad moon on the rise


[Verse 2]

D      A    G       D
I hear hurricanes a blowing
D          A      G      D
I know the end is coming soon
D      A      G   D
I fear rivers overflowing
D          A        G        D
I hear the voice of rage and ruin


[Chorus]

G       
Don't go around tonight
D
'Cause it's bound to take your life
A          G               D
There is a bad moon on the rise


[Verse 3]

D        A        G       D
Hope you got your things together
D            A     G           D
Hope you are quite prepared to die
D                A      G     D
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
D          A     G      D
One eye is taken for an eye


[Chorus]

G       
Don't go around tonight
D
'Cause it's bound to take your life
A          G               D
There is a bad moon on the rise

G       
Don't go around tonight
D
'Cause it's bound to take your life
A          G               D
There is a bad moon on the rise
