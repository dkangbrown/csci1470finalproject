G D 2x

G            D
He had white horses
    G             D
And ladies by the score
G              D
All dressed in satin
    G              D
And waiting by the door

Am            G            D Dsus4 D
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
Am            G            D Dsus4 D
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was

G              D
White lace and feathers
     G           D
They made up his bed
  G            D
A gold covered mattress
   G            D
On which he was laid

Am            G            D Dsus4 D
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
Am            G            D Dsus4 D
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was

G                D
He went to fight wars
        G               D
For his country and his king
       G             D
Of his honor and his glory
    G            D
The people would sing

Am            G            D Dsus4 D
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
Am            G            D Dsus4 D
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was

  G          D
A bullet had found him
    G               D
His blood ran as he cried
   G           D
No money could save him
      G                D
So he laid down and he died

Am            G            D Dsus4 D
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
Am            G            D Dsus4 D
Ooooh, what a lucky man he was
