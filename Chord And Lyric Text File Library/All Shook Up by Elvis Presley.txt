Capo I

     A
Well bless my soul

What's wrong with me?

I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree

My friends say I'm actin' wide as a bug

I'm in love

I'm all shook up
   D   E         A
Uh huh ohh yeah, yeah!

        A
Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak

I can't seem to stand on my own two feet

Now who do you thank when you have such luck?

I'm in love

I'm all shook up
   D   E         A
Uh huh ohh yeah, yeah!

     D
Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
      A
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
     D
When I'm near the girl that I love best
   E
My heart beats so and it scares me to death!

    A
She touched my hand what a chill I got

Her lips are like a volcano that's hot

I'm proud to say she's my buttercup

I'm in love

I'm all shook up
   D   E         A
Uh huh ohh yeah, yeah!

   D
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
   A
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
        D
There's only one cure for this soul of mine
          E
That's to have that girl that I love so fine!
    A
She touched my hand what a chill I got

Her lips are like a volcano that's hot

I'm proud to say she's my buttercup

I'm in love

I'm all shook up
   D   E         A
Uh huh ohh yeah, yeah!

   D   E         A
Uh huh ohh yeah, yeah  2x

I'm all shook up!
