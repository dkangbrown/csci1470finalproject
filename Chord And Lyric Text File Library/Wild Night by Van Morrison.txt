Em
As you brush your shoes
                     G   (G6)
And stand before the mirror
                  Em
And you comb your hair
                       G  (G6)
And grab your coat and hat
        Em
And you walk, wet streets
            G  (G6)
Tryin' to remember
        C
All the wild night breezes
D              G
In your mem'ry ever

         Em                 C
And ev'rything looks so complete
            Em                 C
When you're walkin' out on the street
        Em                C
And the wind catches your feet
              D
And sends you flyin', cryin'

Em   C      D       Em
Oooooooooooooo - wee
         D        G
The wild night is calling, alright
Em   C      D       Em
Oooooooooooooo - wee
         D        G
The wild night is calling.


And all the girls walk by
Dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boobie-woogie
On the corner of the street
And the people passin' by
Just stare in wild wonder
And inside the juke-box
Roars out just like thunder.

Ooooh - wee
The wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
Come on out and dance
Come on out and make romance...
