I was born in a cross-fire hurricane

I was schooled with a strap right across my back

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
       B          A                   B   B A 
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled

I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
