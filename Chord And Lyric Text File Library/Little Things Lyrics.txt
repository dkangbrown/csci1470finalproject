baby please
can't you see
we've already fought too many battles


I know who you are 
a shooting star
who's already 
shined the brightest
than you'll ever 
shine again

Chorus:you know 
it's the little things
that get to you
when something is wrong 
and you don't know what to do

it's the little things
that get you by
living through the past
when there's nothing left to do

Why won't you just let them go
why won't you let them go

I can forgive
and forget 
yet I can't erase
the stigma of what
came long before

I tried so hard
to make things right
I did what I could 
yet it didn't matter
in the end

It was the little things
that reminded me
of what it was 
and would never be

it was the little things
that taunted me
said I'd never amount 
to what I wanted to be

what can't I just let it go
why can't I let it go...

it's okay
it's alright
it is what it is
and will ever be

Not a saint 
not a profit
could change
what had happened
not a thing 
would change 


it's the little things
that inspire

every time you look into the mirror
you see your future self
