
Em            B7              Em
When you came in the air went out
Em         B7            Em
And every shadow filled up with doubt
Am                   Em                   B7                Em
I don't know who you think you are but before the night is through
Em       B7                Em
I wanna do bad things with you

 
[Verse 2]

Em          B7                 Em
I'm the kind to sit up in his room
Em          B7                 Em
Heart sick an' eyes filled up with blue
Am                   Em                   B7                Em
I don't know what you've done to me but I know this much is true
Em       B7                Em
I wanna do bad things with you...okay

Em            B7              Em
When you came in the air went out
Em            B7              Em
And all those shadows there are filled up with doubt
Am                   Em                   B7                Em
I don't know who you think you are but before the night is through
Em       B7                Em
I wanna do bad things with you

I wanna do real bad things with you
