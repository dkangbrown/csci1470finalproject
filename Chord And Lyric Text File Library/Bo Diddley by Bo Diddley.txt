Bo Diddley bought his babe a diamond ring,
E               A          E    E  A\E
If that diamond ring don't shine,
E                     A       E  E  A\E
He gonna take it to a private eye,
E                   A     E  E  A\E
If that private eye can't see
E                        A         E  E  A\E
He'd better not take the ring from me.
