[Verse 1]

E                           Cm
I'm rather upper class high society
E                      Cm
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
E                  
And I always fill my ballrooms
Cm
The event is never small
C
The social pages say I've got
B
The biggest balls of all


[Chorus]

E 
I've got big balls
Cm
I've got big balls
E
They're such big balls
Cm
And they're fancy big balls
E
And he's got big balls
Cm
And she's got big balls
C                         B
But we've got the biggest balls of them all


[Verse 2]

E
And my balls are always bouncing
Cm
My ballroom always full
E                       Cm
And everybody Comes and comes again
E 
If your name is on the guest list
Cm
No one can take you higher
C
Everybody says I've got
B
Great balls of fire!


[Chorus]

E
I've got big balls 
Cm
I've got big balls
E
I've got big balls 
Cm
And there dirty big ball 
E
And he's got big balls 
Cm
And she's got big balls 
C                         B
But we've got the biggest balls of them all


[Verse 3]

E 
Some balls are held for charity
Cm 
And some for fancy dress
E
But when they're held for pleasure
Cm
They're the balls that I like best
E 
My balls are always bouncing
Cm
To the left and to the right
C
It's my belief that my big balls
       B
Should be held every night


[Chorus]

E
I've got big balls 
Cm
I've got big balls 
E
I've got big balls
Cm
And they're such big balls
E
And he's got big balls 
Cm
And she's got big balls
C                         B
But we've got the biggest balls of them all


[Outro]

E                                            Cm
And I'm just itching to tell you about them (we've got big balls)
E                             Cm
Oh we had such wonderful fun (we've got big balls)
E                 Cm     C                          B
Seafood cocktail, crabs, crayfish... (we've got big balls of them all)
