E                            
In the twilight glow I see her
B                                E
Blue eyes cyring in the rain
E                                 
when we kissed goodbye and parted
B                                 E    
I knew we'd never meet again

A
Love is like a dying ember
E                           B
and only memories remain
E                               
Through the ages i'll remember
B                                  E
Blues eyes crying in the rain

(Solo over 1st verse chords)

A
Someday when we meet up yonder
E                                   B
we'll stroll hand in hand again
E
In a land that needs no pardon
B                                      E
my blue eyes crying in the rain
