[Intro] 
G C G C C7 F C G C

[Verse]
          G
Chantilly lace and a pretty face
          C
And a ponytail a-hangin' down
                   G
That wiggle in the walk and giggle in the talk
C                  C7
Makes the world go round
            F              
There ain't nothin' in the world like a big-eyed girl
     C                        
That makes me act so funny, makes me spend my money
G 
Makes me feel real loose like a long-necked goose
C[stop]                          
Like a girl, oh baby, that's what I like

[Chorus] 
G                  C
What's that baby?
     G         C  
But, but, but
   C7       F              
Ohhh honey
    C                G               C 
But...oh, baby, you know what I like

[Verse] 
Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a ponytail a-hangin' down
That wiggle in the walk and giggle in the talk
Makes the world go round
There ain't nothin' in the world like a big-eyed girl
That makes me act so funny, makes me spend my money
Makes me feel real loose like a long-necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's what I like
 
[Chorus] 
G                  C
What's that baby?
     G         C  
But, but, but
   C7       F              
Ohhh honey
    C                G               C 
But...oh, baby, you know what I like
