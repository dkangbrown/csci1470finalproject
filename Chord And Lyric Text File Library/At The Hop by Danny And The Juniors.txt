Bah-bah-bah-bah. bah-bah-bah-bah, at the hop!

              G
Well, you can rock it you can roll it
                                            G7
You can stop and you can stroll it at the hop
         C
When the record starts spinnin'
                                       G
You *chalypso* when you chicken at the hop
       D                       C                          G

You can really start to move it at the hop
          C
Where the jockey is the smoothest
                                    G
And the music is the coolest at the hop
        D                   C                      G
All the cats and chicks can get their kicks at the hop
