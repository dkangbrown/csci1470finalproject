Oh, it's been getting so hard living with the things 
          E       E D  E D
you do to me, aha.
       A
Oh, my dreams are getting so strange I'd like to tell 
                 E    E D  E D
you everything I see.
D           E
Oh, I see a man at the back, as a matter of fact, 

his eyes are red as the sun.

And a girl in the corner, let no one ignore her,

cause she thinks she's the passionate one.
E                     F#                        A
Oh, yeah, it was like lightning, everybody was frightening,
                  C                             E
and the music was soothing, and they all started grooving..
E
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!!

CHORUS:
E       F#                     A                       B
And the man at the back said, everyone attack, and it turned 
                E
into a ballroom blitz.
        F#                        A
And the girl in the corner said, boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll 
B                    E
turn into a ballroom blitz.
D        E      D        E      D        E      D        E      
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz.

D   A
I'm reaching out for something, touching nothing's 
           E   E D  E D
all I ever do.
      A
Oh, I softly call you over, when you appear there's nothing 
        E        E D  E D
left of you, aha.
D        E
Now, the man in the back is ready to crack as he raises 

his hands to the sky.

And the girl in the corner is everyone's mourner..
          
she could kill you with a wink of her eye.
E                F#                        A
Oh, yeah, it was electric, so frightfully hectic..
                     C                              E
and the band started leaving, cause they all stopped breathing..
E
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!!

And the girl in the corner said, boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll
