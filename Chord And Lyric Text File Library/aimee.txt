I can see why you think you belong to me
  A              G        D         A                             D
I never tried to make you think, or let you see one thing for yourself
             C                              D
But now your off with someone else and I'm alone
          C                                    E  E7
You see I thought that I might keep you for my own

A     G              D
Amie, what you wanna do?
A        G                 D
I think, I could stay with you
      Bm                       E  E7
For a while, maybe longer if I do

A  G D  2x

A                   G       D         A          G D
Don't you think the time is right for us to find?
A                 G               D      A                      
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time,
            D
and can you see?
          C                           D
Which way we should turn together or alone
      C                                 E    E7
I can never see what’s right or what is wrong

(will it take to long to see)

A     G              D
Amie, what you wanna do?
A        G                 D
I think, I could stay with you
      Bm                       E  E7
For a while, maybe longer if I do

solo

Well now
A     G              D
Amie, what you wanna do?
A        G                 D
I think, I could stay with you
      Bm                       E  E7
For a while, maybe longer if I do

A  G D  2x

A                G        D           A           G D
Now it's come to what you want you've had your way
            A          G         D         A                      
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray
            D
and can you see;
       C                                 D
that I don't know if it's you or if it's me?
        C                                  E  E7
If it's one of us I'm sure we'll both will see

(Won't you look at me and tell me)

A     G              D
Amie, what you wanna do?
A        G                 D
I think, I could stay with you
      Bm                               E  E7
For a while, maybe longer, longer if I do

Yeah now
A     G              D
Amie, what you wanna do?
A        G                 D
I think, I could stay with you
      Bm                        E  E7
For a while, maybe longer, if I do

I keep..
A                     G         D
Fallin' in and out of love with you
A                     G         D
Fallin' in and out of love with you
A                         G  D
Don't know what I'm gonna do, I'd keep
A                     D  
Fallin' in and out of love
     Dm Dsus2 A
With you
