     C      G           Am     Am7
Mama told me when I was young 
          C       G         Am   Am7
Come sit beside me, my only son 
           C      G          Am  Am7
And listen closely to what I say 
           C
And if you do this 
      G        Am                     Am7
It'll help you some sunny day. Oh Yah! 


              C    G                 Am     Am7
Oh, take your time... Don't live too fast, 
              C   G              Am    Am7
Troubles will come and they will pass. 
              C          G                Am    Am7
You'll find a woman, yea yea, you'll find love, 
          C
And don't forget son, 
         G          Am     
There is someone up above. 
 
 
         C     G         Am   Am7
And be a simple, kind of man. 
      C        G              Am         Am7
Oh be something, you love and understand. 
          C     G         Am   Am7           
Baby be a simple, kind of man. 
              C              G   
Oh, won't you do this for me son, 
       Am   Am7
If you can? 


            C   G                    Am   Am7
Forget your lust, for the rich man's gold 
             C   G            Am    Am7
All that you need, is in your soul, 
            C           G            Am   Am7
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try. 
           C               G
All that I want for you my son, 
      Am           
Is to be satisfied. 

Chorus
               C     G              Am       Am7
Boy, don't you worry... you'll find yourself. 
            C          G             Am    Am7
Follow your heart, lord, and nothing else. 
               C            G        Am   Am7
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try. 
           C               G
All that I want for you my son, 
         Am
Is to be satisfied. 

Chorus
