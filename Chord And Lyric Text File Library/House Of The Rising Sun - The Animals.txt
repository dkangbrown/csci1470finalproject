[Verse 1]

      Am   C        D           F
There is a house in New Orleans
     Am       C      E   E
They call the Risin' Sun
         Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.
    Am     E        Am
And God, I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor.
    Am       C        E     E
She sewed my new blue jeans.
   Am     C     D        F
My father was a gamblin' man
Am      E      Am
Down in New Or-leans.

         Am   C       D       F
Now, the only thing a gambler needs
     Am       C     E     E
Is a suitcase and a trunk
        Am   C         D          F
And the only time that he's satisfied
   Am        E    Am
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh, Mother, tell your children

Not to do what I have done.
Am         C        D          F
Spend your lives in sin and misery
       Am           E      Am
In the house of the risin' sun.

the other foot on the train.

To wear that ball and chain.
