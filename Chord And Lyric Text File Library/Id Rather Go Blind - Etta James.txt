[Verse]

A                        Bm
Something told me it was over
                    A
when I saw you and her talking,
                            Bm
Something deep down in my soul said, ´Cry Girl´,
                         A
when I saw you and that girl, walking out.


[Chorus]    
 
                             Bm
I would rather, I would rather go blind boy,
                                 A
Than to see you, walk away from me child, and all.
       A
Ooooo  So you see, I love you so much
Bm
  That I don't want to watch you leave me baby,
                                   A               
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't want to be free no


[Verse]                                                                          

                  Bm
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
                            A
Of your kisses and your warm embrace, yeah,
                                Bm               
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now baby,
                                  A              
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah.


[Chorus]

                                  Bm
And baby, baby, I would rather be blind boy
                                                  A
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
                                Bm
Baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind now
