Intro:  EDAE (repeat 2x), EDA..

E
When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town

D     A               E
Down around San Antone

E
And the folks are risin' for another day

D      A          E
round about their homes

    C#m                    B (E,B)
The people of the town are strange

            A        A    A#  B C
and they're proud of where they came,

Chorus:

            E                           D     A
Well you're talkin' 'bout China Grove 
     (background vocals:  talkin' 'bout China Grove),

        E
Whoa oh ho...

D   A        E      D   A   E
Who ho China Grove


Well the preacher and the teacher, Lord, they're a caution

They are the talk of the town

When the gossip hits the fan, they ain't lyin'

when the sun goes fallin' down

Well they say that the father's insane,

and dear Missus Perkins a game,

Chorus


Bridge:

G#m B C#m
      Well every day there's a new thing comin',

F#m7                    C#m
The ways of an oriental view.

C#m
The sheriff and his buddies with their samurai swords,

F#                    F#sus4   F#       G#m B 
you can even hear the music at night.

C#m
And though it's a part of the Lone Star state

F#m7                     C#m
The people don't seem to care

A                                       C,D,E  CDE
They'll just keep on lookin' to the east...
