You're always dancing down the street,
          C          F   Bb
with your suede blue eyes
          C                F   Bb
And every new boy that you meet,
           C                F    Bb
he doesn't know the real surprise

         C      F   Bb
Here she comes again,
           F                  Bb     C
when she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
            F        Bb
Ooh, she'll make you flip
         C      F   Bb
Here she comes again,
           F                  Bb     C
when she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
        F                Bb
I kinda like the way she dips

She's my best friend's girl
F        Bb            C  Bb

         C        F   Bb
And your drip dry glove
              C         F   Bb
Ooh, when you bite your lip
            C         F             Bb
It's some reaction to love, ove, ove

         C      F   Bb
