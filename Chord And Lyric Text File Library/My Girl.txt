         C        F           C     F
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
              C            F               C             F
And when it's cold outside, I've got the month of May


  [Chorus]

  C Dm    F   G
  I guess you say,
  C        Dm      F         G
  What can make me feel this way?
  C
  My girl...
                F         G7
  Talkin' 'bout my girl


[Verse]

         C        F           C           F
I've got so much honey the bees envy me
              C            F                   C             F
I've got a sweeter song (baby), than the birds in the trees


  [Chorus]

  C Dm    F   G
  I guess you say,
  C        Dm      F         G
  What can make me feel this way?
  C
  My girl...
                    F         G7
  Talkin' 'bout my girl     (my girl)

         D            G           D          G
I don't need no money, fortune or fame
           D              G                D       G
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim
