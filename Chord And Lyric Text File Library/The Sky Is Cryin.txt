The sky is cryin' 
Can't you see the tears roll down the street 
The sky is cryin' 
Can't you see the tears roll down the street 
I've been looking for my baby 
And I wonder where can she be 

I saw my baby early one morning 
She was walking on down the street 
I saw my baby early this morning 
She was walking on down the street 
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad 
Made my poor heart skip a beat 

I've got a real real real real bad feelin' 
That my baby she don't love me no more 
I've got a real real bad feelin' 
That my baby don't love me no more 
You know the sky, the sky's been cryin', ya 
Can't you see the tears roll down my nose
