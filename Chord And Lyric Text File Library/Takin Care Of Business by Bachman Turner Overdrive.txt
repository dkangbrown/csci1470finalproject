You get up every morning,
           Bb
from your alarm clock's warning,
         F             C
take the 8:15 into the city
                      C7
There's a whistle up above,
           Bb              F            
and people pushing, people shoving,
        C         F           C
and the girls who try to look pretty

                       C7

        Bb             F
you can get to work by nine,
                       Bb              C
and start your slaving job to get your pay
                C7
If you ever get annoyed,
        Bb            F
look at me I'm self-employed,
  C               F           C
I love to work at nothing all day


And I'll be...
C                        Bb

If it were easy as fishing,
          Bb       F
you could be a musician,
             Bb                  C
if you could make sounds loud or mellow
                     C7
Get a second-hand guitar,
            Bb        F

People see you having fun,
       Bb           F
just a-lying in the sun,
                   Bb           C
tell them that you like it this way
                       C7
