Dm          Dm Am Gm
  I'm just a bachelor
                    Gm    C Dm
  I'm looking for a partner
              Dm          Am Gm
  Someone who knows how to ride
               Gm     C Dm
  Without even falling off

  Gotta be compatible
  Takes me to my limits
  Girl when I break you off
  I promise that you won't want to get off


  [Chorus]
  If your horny, Let's do it
  Ride it, My Pony
  My saddle's waiting
  Come and jump on it

  If your horny, Let's do it
  Ride it, My Pony
  My saddle's waiting
  Come and jump on it


  [Verse]
  Sitting here flossing
  Peeping your steelo
  Just once if I have the chance
  The things I will do to you
  You and your body
  Every single portion
  Send chills up and down your spine
  Juices flowing down your thigh

  [Chorus]
  If we're gonna get nasty, Baby
  First we'll show & tell
  Till I reach your ponytail
  Lurk all over and through you baby
  Until I reach the stream
  You'll be on my jockey team
