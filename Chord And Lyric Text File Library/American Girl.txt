[Intro]

Guitar 1:  18 bars  D
Guitar 2:  E7 E7 G G A A D D E7 E7 G G A7 A7


[Verse]

D                E7
Well, she was an American girl
G         A
Raised on promises
D                 E7
She couldn't help thinkin' that there was a 
G                   A
little more to life somewhere else

A                  D
After all it was a great big world
G                      Em
With lots of places to run to
A
And if she had to die tryin' she had one little promise she was gonna keep


[Chorus]

G       A          D                   Bm 
O yeah, all right, take it easy, baby, make it last all night
G       A           D
She was an American girl


[Verse]

D                  E7
Well, it was kinda cold that night
G                      A
She stood alone on the balcony
D                        E7
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
       G              A
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach

A                     D
And for one desperate moment there
G                    Em
He crept back in her memory
A
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach


[Chorus]

G       A          D                   Bm 
O yeah, all right, take it easy, baby, make it last all night
G       A           D
She was an American girl
