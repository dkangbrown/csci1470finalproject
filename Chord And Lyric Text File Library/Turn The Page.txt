Em
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
Dsus2
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one long song
Asus4                                                             Em
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
Em
But your thoughts will soon be wandering, the way they always do
Dsus2
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' much to do
Asus4                                                               Em
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through
Dsus2
Here I am
Em
On the road again
Dsus2
There I am
Em
Up on the stage
Dsus2
Here I go

Playin' star again

So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
Dsus2
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shakin' off the cold
Asus4                                                        Em
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
Em
Most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
Dsus2
All the same old clich?s, Is it woman? is it man?
Asus4                                                    Em
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Em
Make your stand.

Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Dsus2
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
Asus4                                                      Em
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Em
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
Dsus 2
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
Asus4                                                    Em
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said
