   G                                         C
I knew the stakes were high right from the start,
 D                                    G       D
When she dealt the cards I dealt my heart,
    G                                  C
Now I just found a game that I can't play,
 D                               G
This is where the cowboy rides away.


         G                                C
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun,
 D                                    G       D
set - ting all the things I wish I'd done.
      G                           C
It's time to say goodbye to yesterday,
  D                              G
this is where the cowboy rides away.

 G                                          C
We've been in and out of love and in bet - ween,       
D                                         G
And now we've played the final showdown scene.
             G                                    C
And as the cred - its roll a sad song starts to play,
D                               G
This is where the cowboy rides away.

         G                                C
And my heart is sinking like the setting sun,
 D                                    G       D
Set - ting all the things I wish I'd done.
        G                                 C
Oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say,
D                                G
This is where the cowboy rides away.


         G                                C
Oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say,
D                                G
