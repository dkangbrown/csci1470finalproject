        A         D               A       D A                 D              A        D
          Don't want to discuss it  -  I think it's time for a change
          You may get disgusted and start thinkin' that I'm actin' strange
          In that case I'll go underground - get some heavy rest
          Never have to worry about what is worst and what is best (hit it)

                           A    D              A D  A            D                A
                           Oh, oh, Domino    -    roll me over, Romeo
                           D                   A D  A                         D
                           There you go    -    Lord have mercy, I said
                           Oh, oh, Domino - roll me over, Romeo
                           There you go, say it again
                                    Bm  E   A     D   A  D
                           I said oh, oh, Domino
                                    Bm  E   A     D  A D
                           I said oh, oh, Domino   -   dig it
                                                                               A riff

          There's no need for argument - there's no argument at all
          And if you never hear from him - that just means he didn't call
          Or vice-a-versa - that depends on where ever you're at
          And if you never hear from me - that just means I would rather not

                           Oh, oh, Domino - roll me over, Romeo, there you go
                           Lord have mercy, I said
                           Oh, oh, Domino - roll me over, Romeo, there you go
                           Say it again
                           I said oh, oh, Domino
                           I said oh, oh, Domino
