[Verse]

     Em
Get your motor runnin'

Head out on the highway

Lookin' for adventure

In whatever comes our way


[Chorus]

 G       A           E
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
 G         A         E
Take the world in a love embrace
 G    A          E                G  A         E
Fire all of the guns at once and explode into space


[Verse]

  Em
I like smoke and lightnin'

Heavy metal thunder

Wrestlin' with the wind

And the feelin' that I'm under


[Chorus]

 G       A           E
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
 G         A         E
Take the world in a love embrace
 G    A          E                G  A         E
Fire all of the guns at once and explode into space


[Bridge]

        E
Like a true nature's child
         G      
We were born, born to be wild
           A            G             Em
We could climb so high, I never wanna die
 E          D    Db  D 
Born to be wild,
 E          D    Db  D 
Born to be wild,


[Verse]

     Em
Get your motor runnin'

Head out on the highway

Lookin' for adventure

In whatever comes our way


[Chorus]

 G       A           E
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
 G         A         E
Take the world in a love embrace
 G    A          E                G  A          E
Fire all of the guns at once and explode into space


[Bridge]

        E
Like a true nature's child
         G      
We were born, born to be wild
           A            G             Em
We could climb so high, I never wanna die
 E          D    Db  D 
Born to be wild,
 E          D    Db  D 
Born to be wild...
