Ow, uh, alright, uh!
Got to know how to pony
Like Bony Maronie
Mashed potato
Do the alligator
Put your hand on your hips, yeah
Let your backbone slip
Do the watusi
Like my little Lucy
Hey!

Uh, na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, 
I need somebody to help me say it one time
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, Wo-ow!

Sax Solo

Uh, you know I feel alright
Ha, Feel pretty good y'all
Uh, huh!

Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, 
come on y'all, let's say it one more time
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, 
wo-ow!

Twist it in the alley
With long tall Sally
Twistin' with Lucy
Doin' the watusi
Roll over on your back
I like it like that
Do that Jerk-ah
Watch me work y'all

Ow, do it
Wow, do it
Just watch me do it
Aah, help me
Aah, help me
Aah, help me
Aah, help me...
