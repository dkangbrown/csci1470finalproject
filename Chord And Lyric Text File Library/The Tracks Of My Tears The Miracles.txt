G      Am          C           D
People say I'm the life of the party
G                C       Am D C G
Because I tell a joke or two
G                   Am       C        D
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
G      C        Am D C G
Deep inside I'm blue
D         G    Am         C  D
So take a good look at my face
D             G     Am           C   D
You'll see my smile looks out of place
D           G            Am      C   
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
    Am     D  C  G
The tracks of my tears
G      Am   C    G
I need you, need you

G         Am             C            D
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
G                C      Am D C G
Seeming like I'm having fun
G                   Am                C     D
Although she may be cute she's just a substitute
G                  C         Am D C G
Because you're the permanent one
D         G    Am         C  D
So take a good look at my face
D             G     Am           C   D
You'll see my smile looks out of place
D           G            Am      C   
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
    Am     D  C  G
The tracks of my tears
G      Am   C    G
I need you, need you
   Bm             C  G
Outside I'm masquerading
  Bm              C  G
Inside my hope is fading
       Bm
Just a clown oh yeah
          C      G
Since you put me down
   G     D  A  G    A
My smile is my make up
  G    D     A  G     A  G    A
I wear since my break up with you
D         G    Am         C  D
So take a good look at my face
D             G     Am           C   D
You'll see my smile looks out of place
D           G            Am      C

    Am     D  C  G
The tracks of my tears
