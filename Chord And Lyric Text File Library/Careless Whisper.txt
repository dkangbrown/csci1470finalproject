Dm Gm Bb Am x 2


[Verse]

Dm                                               
I feel so unsure
Gm                               Bb            Am
as I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
Dm                 Gm
as the music dies, something in your eyes
Bb
calls to mind the silver screen
Am
and all its sad good-byes


[Pre-Chorus]

Dm
I'm never gonna dance again
Gm
guilty feet have got no rhythm
Bb
though it's easy to pretend
Am
I know you're not a fool


[Chorus]

Dm
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
Gm
and waste the chance that I've been given
Bb
so I'm never gonna dance again
Am
the way I danced with you

    Dm Gm Bb Am
oohh

{all the same chords}


[Verse]

Dm                Gm   
Time can never mend
Bb                    Am
the careless whispers of a good friend
Dm                
to the heart and mind
 Gm
ignorance is kind
Bb
there's no comfort in the truth
Am               
pain is all you'll find


[Pre-Chorus]

Dm  
I'm never gonna dance again
Gm  
guilty feet have got no rhythm
Bb
though it's easy to pretend
  Am
I know you're not a fool


[Chorus]

Dm
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
Gm
and waste the chance that I've been given
Bb
so I'm never gonna dance again
Am                          Dm   Gm   Bb 
the way I danced with you
                       Am
Never without your love


[Bridge]

Dm  
Tonight the music seems so loud
Gm
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Bb
Maybe it's better this way
Am
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

Dm  
We could have been so good together
Gm
We could have lived this dance forever
Bb                           Am
But noone's gonna dance with me

Please stay


[Pre-Chorus]

Dm  
I'm never gonna dance again
Gm  
guilty feet have got no rhythm
Bb
though it's easy to pretend
  Am
I know you're not a fool


[Chorus]

Dm
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
Gm
and waste the chance that I've been given
Bb
so I'm never gonna dance again
Am                         
the way I danced with you


[Outro]

 Dm               Gm                     Bb    Am
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
 Dm               Gm                     Bb    
(Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong
                 Am     
that you had to leave me alone
