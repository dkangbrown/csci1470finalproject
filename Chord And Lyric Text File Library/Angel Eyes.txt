C     Em             Fmaj7  G
Girl, you're looking fine tonight
C         Em            Fmaj7    G
And every guy has got you in his sight
F           Em         Dm           C
What you're doing with a clown like me
F            Em               D7
Is surely one of life's little mysteries


[Chorus]

     C          Em
So tonight I'll ask
F          G
The stars above
C         Em    F        G
"How did I ever win your love?"
F        C
What did I do,
E        Am
What did I say
F            C     G          C
To turn your angel eyes my way

[Verse]

C              Em      Fmaj7      G
Well I'm the guy never learned to dance
C     Em         Fmaj7     G
Never even got one second glance
F          Em           Dm         C
Across the crowded room was close enough
F       Em              D7
I could look but I could never touch


[Chorus]

     C          Em
So tonight I'll ask
F          G
The stars above
C         Em    F        G
"How did I ever win your love?"
F        C
What did I do,
E        Am
What did I say
F            C     G          C
To turn your angel eyes my way


F    C   F   C
Don't anyone wake me
   Dm7         Am7
If it's just a dream
                 F    C
'cause she's the best thing
     Am
Ever happened to me
        F  C
All you fellows
        Dm7          Am
You can look all you like
         Dm                 Em
But this girl, you see, she leaving here
     F    G
with me tonight


[Solo]


[Verse]

C               Em                Fmaj7   G
Um, there's just one more thing I need to know
C          Em                Fmaj7    G
If this is love, why does it scare me so?
F          Em             Dm      C
It must be something only you can see
F             Em              D7
'cause girl I feel it when you look at me


[Chorus] (2x)

     C          Em
So tonight I'll ask
F          G
The stars above
C         Em    F        G
"How did I ever win your love?"
F        C
What did I do,
E        Am
What did I say
F            C     G          C
