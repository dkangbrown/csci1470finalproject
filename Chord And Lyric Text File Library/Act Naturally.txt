[Root] G


[Verse 1]
G                            C
They're gonna put me in the movies
G                                     D7
they're gonna make a big star out of me
      G                                       C
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
    D7                           G
and all I gotta do is act naturally

           D7                     G
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
      D7                             G
might win an Oscar you can never tell
    D7                     G
the movies gonna make me a big star
       A7                         D7
'Cause I can play the part so well


[Verse 2]
       G                                C
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
G                                 D7
then I know that you will plainly see
    G                                 C
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
    D7                           G
and all I gotta do is act naturally


[Verse 3]
      G                                           C
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
    G                           D7
and beggin down upon his bended knee
     G                                  C
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsin'
  D7                        G
