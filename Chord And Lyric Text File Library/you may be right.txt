[Verse 1]

A
Friday night I crashed your party,    

Saturday I said I'm sorry
                                   E7
Sunday came and trashed me out again.
       Bm
I was only having fun,   
         G
Wasn't hurting anyone
        E  
And we all enjoyed the 
                 A       
Weekend for a change.

           A             
I've been stranded in the combat zone, 

I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
                                 E7
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain.
         Bm
And you told me not to drive,  
       G 
But I made it home alive 
         E                                A       A        
So you said that only proves that I'm insane.


[Chorus]

                  E 
You may be right,   
                 A
I may be crazy
            E             D
Oh but it just may be a lunatic 
        F#m             A 
You're looking for
                     E
Turn out the light,
                    A
Don't try to save me
             D              E                              
You may be wrong for all i know, 
                  A     intro (4x)
But you may be right. 


[Verse 2]

A                                
Remember how I found you there

Alone in your electric chair
                                   E7
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
          Bm
You were lonely for a man
          G
I said "Take me as I am"
             E                            A
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for awhile

A
Now think of all the years you tried to

Find someone to satisfy you
                            E7
I might be as crazy as you say 
        Bm
If I'm crazy then it's true
           G
That it's all because of you
         E                          A
And you wouldn't want me any other way


[Chorus]

                  E 
You may be right,   
                 A
I may be crazy
            E             D
Oh but it just may be a lunatic 
        F#m             A 
You're looking for
                       E
It's too late to fight
                      A
It's too late to change me
             D              E                              
You may be wrong for all i know, 
                  A     (intro x4)
But you may be right.

You may be wrong but you may be right
