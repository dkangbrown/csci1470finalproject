D    Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D  G/B

[Verse 1]
        C         G/B                      A           G
And the sign says long haired freaky people need not apply
    D               A                G                  A
So I tuck my hair under my hat and I went in to ask him why
Bm                                               G
  He said you look like a fine outstanding young man, I think you'll do
     D                         A                 G               A
So I took off my hat and said imagine that, huh, me working for you


[Chorus]
D             C            G
Signs, signs, everywhere a sign
D                       C           G
Fuckin' up the scenery, breakin' my mind
D                 A
Do this, don't do that,
                    C      D    Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D  G/B
Can't you read the sign?


[Verse 2]
        C                 G/B               A                G
And the sign says anybody caught trespassing will be shot on sight
     D                    A                       G                   A
So I jumped the fence and yelled at the house hey, what gives you the right
   Bm                                   G
To put up a fence to keep me out, or to keep mother nature in
   D                 A                     G                       A
If God was here he'd tell it to your face, man you're some kind of sinner


[Chorus]
D             C            G
Signs, signs, everywhere a sign
D                       C           G
Fuckin' up the scenery, breakin' my mind
D                 A
Do this, don't do that,
                    C
Can't you read the sign?


[Bridge]
D     C G E/G#

   A
Oh say now mister, can't you read
    G                      D
you gotta have a shirt and tie to get a seat
D                   A
you can't watch, no you can't eat
G                     D  D    Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D
you ain't supposed to be here...
 N.C.
And the sign says you got to have a membership card to get inside..  Uh!


[Instrumental]
D    C  G  D    G
D    A     C
D    Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D  G/B


[Verse 3]
        C         G/B                     A                  G
And the sign says Everybody welcome, come in, kneel down and pray
         D                            A                    G                      A
And they passed around a plate at the end of it all, and I didn't have a penny to pay
     Bm                            G    
So I got me a pen and paper, and I made out my own fuckin' sign
       D                    A                       G              A
I said Thank you, Lord, for thinkin' 'bout me, I'm alive and doin' fine


[Chorus]
D             C            G
Signs, signs, everywhere a sign
D                       C           G
Fuckin' up the scenery, breakin' my mind
D                 A
Do this, don't do that
                    C
Can't you read the sign?
D             C            G
Signs, signs, everywhere a sign
D                       C           G
Fuckin' up the scenery, breakin' my mind
D                 A
Do this, don't do that
                    C      D
Can't you read the sign?
