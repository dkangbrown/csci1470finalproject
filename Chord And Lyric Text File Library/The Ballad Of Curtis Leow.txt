[Verse]

       E                           B
Well I used to wake the morning before the rooster crowed
E                                 A               F#  F#
   Searching for soda bottles to get myself some dough
E                                 B                       
   Brought em down to the corner, down to the country store
A                                    A7               E
   Cash em in and give my money to a man named curtis loew



E              B              A              E
Old curt was a black man with white curly hair
E             B                D              A
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
E                     B              A                  E
He used to own an old dobro, used to play it across his knee
E           B                  D                 E  E7
Id give old curt my money, hed play all day for me


[Chorus]

A                     E            E7
Play me a song curtis loew, curtis loew
A                          E              E7
I got your drinking money, tune up your dobro
A                                E              F#  F#
People said he was useless, them people are the fools
      E                   D                     A        E
cause curtis loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues

[Verse]

E               B      A               E
He looked to be sixty, and maybe I was ten
E            B              D            A
Mama used to whip me but Id go see him again
E                 B               A              E  
Id clap my hands, stomp my feets, try to stay in time
E             B
Hed play me a song or two
     D                     E    E7
Then take another drink of wine.


[Chorus]

A                     E            E7
Play me a song curtis loew, curtis loew
A                          E              E7
I got your drinking money, tune up your dobro
A                                E              F#   F#
People said he was useless, them people are the fools
      E                   D                A              E
cause curtis loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues

[Verse]

E              B            A              E
On the day old curtis died, nobody came to pray
E           B                         D                  A
Ol preacher said some words, and they chunked him in the clay
E              B        A                     E
But he lived a lifetime playin the black mans blues
E                 B                    D             E    E7 
And on the day he lost his life, thats all he had to lose


[Chorus]

A                     E                     E7
Play me a song curtis loew, hey curtis loew
A                           E                   E7
I wish that you was here so everyone would know
A                           E                    F#
People said he was useless, them people all are fools
      E                D                A              E
cause curtis youre the finest picker to ever play the blues
