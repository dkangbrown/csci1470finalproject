C          F
I found my thrill
             C
On Blueberry Hill
             G7
On Blueberry Hill
             C
When I found you

               F
The moon stood still
             C
On Blueberry Hill
              G7
It lingered until
               C
My dreams came true

    G           C
The wind in the willow played
       G7        C
Love's sweet melody
    B7           Em       B7
But all of those vows you made
     B7       E G7
Were never to be

              F
Though we're apart
                  C
You're part of me still
                G7
For you were my thrill
             C
On Blueberry Hill

    G           C
The wind in the willow played
       G7        C
Love's sweet melody
    B7           Em       B7
But all of those vows you made
     B7       E G7
Were never to be

              F
Though we're apart
                  C
You're part of me still
                G7
For you were my thrill
             C
On Blueberry Hill
