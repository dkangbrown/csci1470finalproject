Capo 4


[Verse 1]

   C               G              Am           
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
F                       C   G 
 If'n you don't know by now 
       C               G              Am       
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
D7                   G
  It'll never do somehow 
          C                    C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn 
F                         D7
 Look out your window and I'll be gone 
C          G          Am        F
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on 
C           G               C
Don't think twice, it's all right 


[Verse 2]

   C               G               Am  
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light,babe
     F             C      G
That light I never knowed
       C               G               Am          
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light,babe
D7                           G  
 I'm on the dark side of the road
        C                                  C7
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
   F                         D7
To try and make me change my mind and stay
C        G            Am         F
We never did too much talkin' anyway
C            G             C
Don't think twice,it's all right


[Verse 3]

   C               G              Am   
It ain't no use in callin' out my name,babe
F                     C    G
 Like you never did before
       C               G              Am        
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name,babe
D7                   G 
 I can't hear you anymore
      C                        C7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' all the way down the road
  F                     D7
I once loved aw woman,a child I'm told
  C           G             Am        F
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
C           G              C
Don't think twice,it's all right


[Verse 4]

   C   G            Am
So loooooong, honey babe
          F             C    G
Where I'm bound,I can't tell
    C         G          Am       
But goodbye's too good a word,babe
D7                          G
 So I'll just say fare thee well
C                          C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    F                          D7
You could have done better but I don't mind
C              G        Am        F       
You just kinda wasted my precious time
    C           G              C
But don't think twice,it's all right
