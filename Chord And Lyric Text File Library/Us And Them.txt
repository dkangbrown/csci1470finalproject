And after all we're only ordinary men.
Dsus2   Esus2/D     Dmmaj7
Me, and you.
                             G/D                    D  A/C#
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do.

Forward he cried from the rear
              Bm/A  D/G  C
and the front rank died.
    Bm                                    A
The general sat and the lines on the map

Black and blue
                                 G/D            Dsus2

       Esus2/D  Dmmaj7
Up and down.
                         G/D                         D  A/D A/C#
And in the end it's only round and round and round.

Down and out
                                 G/D                D
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about.
Dsus2     Esus2/D   Dmmaj7

                               G/D                  D
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
