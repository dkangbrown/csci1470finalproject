                         G   (strum)
Riding along in my automobile
                              (strum)
My baby beside me at the wheel
                                C   (strum)
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
                     G   (strum)
My curiosity running wild
                             D (strum)
Cruising and playing the radio
                            G  (strum)
With no particular place to go.

                         G   (strum)
Riding along in my automobile
                                         (strum)
I was anxious to tell her the way I feel,
                            C   (strum)
So I told her softly and sincere,
                                   G  (strum)
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
                          D    (strum)
Cuddling more and driving slow,
                            G  (strum)
With no particular place to go.

                       G  
No particular place to go,
                                  
So we parked way out on the Kokomo
                                     C   (strum)
The night was young and the moon was gold
                             G     (strum)
So we both decided to take a stroll
                          D    (strum)
Can you imagine the way I felt?
                               G    (strum)
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt!

                       G    (strum)
Riding along in my calaboose
                                  (strum)
Still trying to get her belt loose
                          C      (strum)
All the way home I held a grudge,
                                  G    (strum)
For the safety belt that wouldn't budge
                             D (strum)
Cruising and playing the radio
                            G  
With no particular place to go.
