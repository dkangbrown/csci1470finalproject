D                  A                     D    A
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
D                   A                   D              A
Looking back at the years gone by, like so many summer fields
D                   A              D            A
In sixty-five I was seventeen, and running up 101
D                      A                     E
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

        D              A
Running on, running on empty
        D           A
Running on, running blind 
        D                    A                      F#m   E
Running on, running into the sun, but I m running behind.

D                 A                     D         A
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
D                A                     D        A
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
D                   A               D                  A
In sixty-nine I was twenty-one, and called the road my own
D                      A                    E
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on.

        D              A
Running on, running on empty
        D           A
Running on, running blind 
        D                    A                      F#m   E
Running on, running into the sun, but I m running behind.

F#m        D     E            A
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
F#m              E           D
People need some reason to believe;
        E          A          D         
I don't know about anyone but me
F#m             D      E               A
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
D                   E              D    Bm A E A
If I can get you to smile before I leave

D                  A                     D      A
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
D                   A                     D               A
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
D                     A                 D                   A
I look around for the friends I used to turn to, to pull me through
D                  A               E
Looking into their eyes I see them running too

        D              A
Running on, running on empty
        D           A
Running on, running blind 
        D                    A                      F#m   E
Running on, running into the sun, but I m running behind.

D                A                      D               A
Honey you really tempt me; you know the way you look so kind
D           E                    D         A   Bm A E A 
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
D                     E             D         A   Bm A E A 
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
D                E           D         A   Bm A E A
Running into the sun but I'm running behind.
