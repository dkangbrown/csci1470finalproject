[Intro]

A  D/F#  Dm/F  Em7  A


[Verse]

Bb          F/A                   C               G
 Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Bb               F/A                C
 And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Bb          F/A                   C                G
 Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
    Bb           F/A       Ab
You hung me on a line and maybe I'm amazed
   Eb/G             C
At the way I really need you


[Chorus]

D            A/D
 Baby, I'm a man,
            D9                                D7
maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something
G                              D 
 that he doesn't really understand
D            A/D
 Baby, I'm a man,
                     D9                        D7
And maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me
G                               D/F#   Dm/F   Em7   A7
 Baby won't you help me to understand

You right me when I'm wrong and maybe I'm amazed
