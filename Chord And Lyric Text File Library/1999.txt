Don't worry, I wont hurt u
I only want u 2 have some fun
I was dreamin when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin
Coulda sworn it was judgment day
The sky was all purple,
There were people runnin everywhere
Tryin 2 run from the destruction,
U know I didn't even care

Cuz they say two thousand zero zero party over,
Oops out of time
So tonight Im gonna party like it's 1999

I was dreamin when I wrote this
So sue me if I go 2 fast
But life is just a party, and parties werent meant 2 last
War is all around us, my mind says prepare 2 fight
So if I gotta die Im gonna listen 2 my body tonight

Yeah, they say two thousand zero zero party over,
Oops out of time
So tonight Im gonna party like it's 1999
Yeah

Lemme tell ya somethin
If u didn't come 2 party,
Don't bother knockin on my door
I got a lion in my pocket,
And baby he's ready 2 roar
Yeah, everybodys got a bomb,
We could all die any day
But before I'll let that happen,
Ill dance my life away

Oh, they say two thousand zero zero party over,
Oops out of time
