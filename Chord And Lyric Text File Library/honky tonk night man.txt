I'm a honky tonk night time man I can't stand no light
I'm a honky tonk night time man I can't stand no light
I get my rest in the daytime I make my running round at night

I had the blues this morning I had the blues all day today
I had the blues this morning I had the blues all day today
But when the sun goes down I'm gonna tuck my blues away away

Lord my heart starts beatin' when the sun starts sinking low
Lord my heart starts beatin' when the sun starts sinking low
When the shadows fall I know it's time to go

I'm a honky tonk night time man
