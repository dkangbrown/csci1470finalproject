Am (hammer on index finger)  G    Dsus2   Am


[Verse]

Am                G
She grew up in an Indiana town
      Dsus2                      Am
Had a good lookin' momma who never was around
       Am                    G
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
          Dsus2                  Am
With them Indiana boys on an Indiana night


[Verse 2]

Am                                 G
Well she moved down here at the age of 18
            Dsus2                                Am
She blew the boys away, it was more than they'd seen
Am                                G
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
            Dsus2                               Am
She said, "I dig you baby but I got to keep movin'"
Am      G    Dsus2    Am
...on, keep movin' on


[Chorus]

Em7
Last dance with Mary Jane
Em7                         A
One more time to kill the pain
Em7 
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Em7                   A      G
 Tired of this town again


[Verse 3]

Am                   G
Well I don't know but I've been told
         Dsus2                     Am
You never slow down, you never grow old
Am                  G
I'm tired of screwing up, I'm tired of bein' down
Dsus2                               Am
I'm tire of myself, I'm tired of this town


[Bridge]

Am                   G
Oh my my, oh hell yes
         Dsus2              Am
Honey put on that party dress
Am                        G
Buy me a drink, sing me a song,
Dsus2                           Am
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long


[Chorus]

Em7
Last dance with Mary Jane
Em7                         A
One more time to kill the pain
Em7 
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Em7                   A      G
 Tired of this town again


[Verse 4]

Am                   G
There's pidgeons down in Market Square
         Dsus2                     Am
She's standin' in her underwear
Am                  G
Lookin' down from a hotel room
Dsus2                               Am
Nightfall will be comin' soon


[Bridge]

Am                   G
Oh my my, oh hell yes
         Dsus2              Am
You've got to put on that party dress
Am                        G
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
Dsus2                           Am
I hit my last number I walked to the road


[Chorus]

Em7

Em7                         A
One more time to kill the pain

I feel summer creepin' in and I'm
Em7                   A      G
