
[Verse 1]

C                            Am
Every night I hope and pray, a dream lover will come my way
C                             Am
A girl to hold in my arms and know the magic of her charms
          C   / /     G7   / /      C   / /     F
Because I want      a girl      to call      my own
         C     Am       Dm7             G7       C    G///
I want a dream lover so I won't have to dream alone.


[Verse 2]

C                            Am
Dream lover, where are you - with a love oh so true,
C                              Am
And a hand that I can hold, to feel you near when I grow old?
          C    / /     G7  / /     C    / /     F
Because I want      a girl      to call      my own
         C     Am       Dm7             G7       C     C7
I want a dream lover so I won't have to dream alone.


[Bridge]

F
Some-day, I don't know how
C
I hope you'll hear my plea
D7
Some-way, I don't know how
G7
She'll bring her love to me


[Verse 3]

C                        Am
Dream lover, until then, I'll go to sleep and dream again
C                            Am
That's the only thing to do, until my lover's dreams come true
          C    / /    G7   / /     C    / /     F
Because I want      a girl      to call      my own
         C     Am       Dm7             G7       C
I want a dream lover so I won't have to dream alone.
