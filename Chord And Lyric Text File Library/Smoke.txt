[Verse]

            G                                         C
She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy
               G                                     C
She'll be the first damn thing I want when I start drinking
      Em                                      
I'm breathing her in, breathing her out
     C
Once I pick her up, I can't put her down


[Chorus]

       G
She's smoke
                        C
I pull her in nice and slow
                              Em
She's a habit and I can't let go
         C
Blowing rings around my heart
              G
The one she stole
                     C
Watching her swayin low
                       Em
It's killing me and I know
       C
Can't stop her once you start
       G     C
She's smoke


[Verse]

            G                                       C
She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy
          G                                         C
She goes great with an ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey
     Em                      
Put one in my hand, her on my lips
 C
Man, that's as good as it gets


[Chorus]

       G
She's smoke   
                        C 
I pull her in nice and slow
                              Em
She's a habit and I can't let go
         C
Blowing rings around my heart
             G
The one she stole
                     C
Watching her swayin low
                       Em
It's killing me and I know
       C
Can't stop her once you start
       G    C  G  C
She's smoke

          G
When the night burns out
        C
And we all go home
          G
Smell of sweet perfume
     C
All over your clothes
      G    C
Like smoke
      G    C
Like smoke 


[Chorus]

        G
She's smoke
                        C
I pull her in nice and slow
                              Em
She's a habit and I can't let go
         C
Blowing rings around my heart
             G
The one she stole
                     C
Watching her swayin low
                       Em
It's killing me and I know
       C
Can't stop her once you start
       G    C
She's smoke
       G    C
She's smoke

          G
When the night burns out
        C
And we all go home
          G
Smell of sweet perfume
     C
All over your clothes
        G   C
She's smoke
        G   C
She's smoke
