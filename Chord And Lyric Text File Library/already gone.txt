                  G                 D                C         Bb
          Well, I heard some people talking just the other day
                   G                   D            C
          And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
                                     G                 D
          Well, let me tell you I've got some news for you
                     C
          And you'll soon find out it's true
                          G                 D                C
          And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself
 
  
          [Chorus]

                  G          D        C             G    D           C
          Coz I'm al      -     ready gone, and I'm fee--ee--eeling strong
                 G   D                C             G      D          C
          I will si--ing this vict'ry song,  woo-oo-oo, my my, woo-oo-oo
 
 
          [Verse 2]

                   G                 D                C         Bb
          The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
                   G                   D            C
          But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
                                     G                 D
          Just remember this my girl when you look up in the sky
                     C                          G                 D                C
          You can see the stars and still not see the light, that's right
 

          [Chorus]

                  G          D        C             G    D           C
          Coz I'm al      -     ready gone, and I'm fee--ee--eeling strong
                 G   D                C             G      D          C

                   G                 D                C         Bb
          Well, I know it wasn't you who held me down.
                   G                   D            C
          Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
                                     G                 D
          So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains
                     C                          G                 D                C
          That we never even know we have the key
 

          [Chorus]

                  G          D        C             G    D           C
          Me, I'm already gone, and I'm feeling strong
                 G   D                C             G      D          C
          I will sing this vict'ry song, coz I'm already gone
 
 
          [Chorus]

                  C          G         F              C  G          F
          Coz I'm al      -     ready gone, and I'm fee--ee--eeling strong
                 C   G                F              C      G             F

                  C          G         F              C  G          F
          Yes, I'm already gone, already gone (awright, nighty night)
                   G             F
          Already gone, already gone
