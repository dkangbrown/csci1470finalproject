[Verse]
C
When I get older losing my hair,
                 G
Many years from now,

Will you still be sending me a valentine
(G   A   Bb  B)    C
Birthday greetings bottle of wine?


[Verse]
C
If I'd been out till quarter to three
C7                 F
Would you lock the door,
F              Fm       C/G            A
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
D        G7    C
When I'm sixty-four?


[Verse]
|Am  |-      |G      |Am    |

Am              E
You'll be older too,
Am                Dm

.......And if you say the word,
F       G         C       G     (G B D F)
I could stay with you.


[Verse]
C
I could be handy mending a fuse
                       G
When your lights have gone.

You can knit a sweater by the fireside
(G A   Bb B)    C
Sunday mornings go for a ride.

C
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
C7                F
Who could ask for more?

Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
D        G7    C
When I'm sixty-four?


[Verse]
Am                                                G 
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight,
                Am   
If it's not too dear
Am                  E
We shall scrimp and save
Am                   Dm
(ah ah ...)
.......Grandchildren on your knee
F     G          C       G      (G B D F)
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

Stating point of view.

Yours sincerely, Wasting Away.
