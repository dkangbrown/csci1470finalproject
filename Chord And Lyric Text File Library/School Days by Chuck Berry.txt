Up in the mornin' and out to school,

The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule,
G7                             C
American history and practical math,
                                 G
You study 'em hard and hopin' to pass.
                                       D
Workin' your fingers right down to the bone,
        C                              G
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone.


G
Ring, ring goes the bell.

The cook in the lunch room's ready to sell.
G7                             C
You're lucky if you can find a seat,
                                     G
You're fortunate if you have time to eat.
                                 D
Back in the classroom, open your books,
             C                               G
Gee, but the teacher don't know how mean she looks.


G
Soon as three o'clock rolls around,

You finally lay your burden down.
G7                                   C
Close up your books, get out of your seat,
                            G
Down the halls and into the street.
                                D
Up to the corner and 'round the bend,
             C                 G
Right to the juke joint, you go in.



G
Drop the coin right into the slot,

You're gotta hear somethin' that's really hot.
G7                                   C
With the one you love, you're makin' romance,
                                 G
All day long you been wantin' to dance,
                               D
Feeling the music from head to toe,
          C                   G
Round and round and round you go.


G
Hail, hail rock and roll!

Deliver me from the days of old,
G7                 C
Long live rock and roll,
                                G
The beat of the drums, loud and bold.
                     D
Rock, rock, rock and roll,
    C                          G
The feelin' is there, body and soul.
