Bb7  
There's a Red House over yonder
Eb9                       Bb7   Bb7
That's where my baby stays
Eb9
There's a Red House over yonder, baby
                          Bb7  Bb7
That's where my baby stays
        F9                           Eb9
Well, I ain't been home to see my baby,
                               Bb7    |Bb7 F9|
in ninety nine and one half days.
Bb7                                
Wait a minute something's wrong here
Eb9
The key won't unlock the door.
Bb7
Wait a minute something's wrong,
Eb9                                           Bb7  Bb7
Lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door,
(something's goin' on here.)
F9
I have a bad bad feeling
        Eb9                        Bb7
that my baby don't live here no more.
                                 F9
    That's all right, I still got my guitar
    Look out now . . .

[Outro]
Bb7                                           Eb9
Well I might as well uh, go on back down yonder
                          Bb7   Bb7
way back 'cross yonder hill
Eb9
I might as well go back over yonder
                                   Bb7
way back over yonder 'cross the hill,
(That's where I came from.)
             F9                         Eb9 (hard stop)
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more,
                       Bb7 Ddim7 Eb9 Edim7 F9, E9 Bb7
I know her sister will!
