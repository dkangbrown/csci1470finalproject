[Root] D

[Verse 1]

D          Cadd9  G          D       Cadd9  G
night falls,       and im alone
 D      Cadd9  G                 D   Cadd9  G
skin,   yeah chilled me to the bone
D     Cadd9  G                D      Cadd9  G
you,         turned and you ran,
  D        Cadd9 G               D   Cadd9  G
oh slipped,      right from my hand


[Chorus]

      D
hey, blue on black
      D
tears on a river
     C         
push on a shove
  G
it dont mean much
     D
joker on jack
     D
match on a fire
     C
cold on ice
  G
a dead mans touch
      D
wisper on a scream
         C        G
doesnt change a thing
             A         G
dont bring you back
       D          C  G
blue on black



[Verse]

D         Cadd9  G             D       Cadd9  G
Blind,      now I see
D         Cadd9  G             D       Cadd9  G
Truth,   Lies and in between
D         Cadd9  G             D       Cadd9  G
Wrong,         can't be undone
D         Cadd9  G             D       Cadd9  G
slipped,      from the tip of your tongue



[Chorus]  x4 solos in between

      D
hey, blue on black
      D
tears on a river
     C         
push on a shove
  G
it dont mean much
     D
joker on jack
     D
match on a fire
     C
cold on ice
  G
a dead mans touch
      D
wisper on a scream
         C        G
doesnt change a thing
             A         G
dont bring you back
       D          C  G
blue on black

easy and fun
