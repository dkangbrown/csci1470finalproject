G         Am             G  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
C                  D                 Em
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
D           C
All your    life
G               A                D         G
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Take these sunken eyes and learn to see

All your    life
G             A                D            G
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
