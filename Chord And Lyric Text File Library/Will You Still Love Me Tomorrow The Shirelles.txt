C              Am                 Dm      G 
Tonight you're mine completely 
C             Am                           G 
You give your love... so sweetly 
    E         E7       Am             Am 
Tonight, the light of love is in your eyes 
Dm7          G                  C 
But will you love me tomorrow? 
 

C              Am       Dm      G 
Is this a lasting treasure 
C             Am               G 
Or just a moment's pleasure? 
 E         E7       Am             Am 
Can I believe the magic of your sighs? 
Dm7          G                  C 
Will you still love me tomorrow? 
 
 
F                     Em 
Tonight with words unspoken 
F                    C 
You say that I'm the only one 
F                     Em 
But will my heart be broken 
         Am              D7      Dm7   G7 
When the night meets the morning sun? 
 
 
C           Am              Dm      G 
I have to know... that your love 
C             Am               G 
Is a love I can ... be sure of, 
E               E7            Am             Am 
So tell me now, and I won't ask again  
Dm7                 G                  C 
Will you still love me tomorrow?  
Dm7                 G                  C 
Will you still love me tomorrow?
