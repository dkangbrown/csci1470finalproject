INTRO- G D C G,  THEN- C D G
VERSE 1
C                        D          G
Now, every time that I come home nobody wants to let me be.
C                    D                    G
Seems that all the friends I've got just got to come interrogate me.
C             D                   Em                                       C
Well, I appreciate your feelings, and I don't want to pass you by,
G             D                           C                G
But I don't ask you about your business. Don't ask me about mine.
VERSE 2
C                      D                                 G
Well, it's true I love the money, and I love my brand new car.
C                          D                              G
I like drinkin' the best of whiskey and playin' in a honky-tonk bar.
C           D            Em         C
But when I come off the road, well I just got to have my time,
G           D            C             G
Cause I've got to find a break in this action, else I'm gonna lose my mind.

CHORUS
     G              D             C               G
So don't ask me no questions And I won't tell you no lies.
  G          D          C          G
Don't ask me about my business, And I won't tell you goodbye.

SOLO BREAK- Same chords as verse

VERSE 3

'What's your color? Do you dig the brothers?" is driving me up the wall,
And every time I think that I can sleep, some fool has got to call.
Well, don't you think that when I come home I just want a little piece of mind?
If you want to talk about this business, buddy, you're just wasting time.

CHORUS
So don't ask me no questions And I won't tell you no lies.
don't ask me about my business, And I won't tell you goodbye.
I said don't ask no stupid questions And I won't send you away.
If you want to talk fishin', Well I guess that'll be OK.
